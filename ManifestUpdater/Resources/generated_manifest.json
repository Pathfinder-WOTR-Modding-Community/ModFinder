You can only select one or the other)\n * Military Tradition\n * Practiced Hunter\n * Unstoppable Magic\n\n### Half Elf\n * Eye For Opportunity\n * Weapon Familiarity\n * Fixed vanilla Kindred-Raised trait - can no longer get +4 CHA\n\n### Oread\n * Crystalline Form\n * Granite Skin\n\n### Aasimar\n* Celestial Crusader\n* Crusading Magic\n* Deathless Spirit\n* Exalted Resistance\n* Heavenborn\n* Lost Promise\n\n### Tiefling\n* Beguiling Liar\n* Maw or Claw\n* Scaled Skin\n* Smite Good\n\n## Install Instructions\n 1. Download the mod from the releases page\n 2. Using [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) - on the mods tab, drag the zip onto the window\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThis was only possible thanks to the assistance of \nthe [Pathfinder Wrath of The Righteous Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) modding dev channel.\nIn particular: @Vek17, @bubbles, @WittleWolfie, @WraithJT, @Sparhawk\n\nVek17's [TableTopTweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) mod,\nand Wolfie's [Modding Wiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki)\nwhich were both a huge help in learning how to mod this game.\n",

    "Description": "# Automatic Bonus Progression\n\nAn item rebalance mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous based on Pathfinder's [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/unchained-rules/automatic-bonus-progression/) ruleset. **This is not compatible with controllers.**\n\n![Progression screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/progression.png)\n\n### This mod creates a save dependency. Once you save with this mod enabled it must remain enabled or you will lose access to the save.\n\n### [Settings are NOT in UMM, they use Mod Menu](#mod-options) \n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile a [bug](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [feature request](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D). You can also reach me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) in the #mod-user-general channel.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload [AutomaticBonusProgression.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/releases/latest) and install it using ModFinder or Unity Mod Manager. Make sure to install [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) as well.\n\n### If you use this on an existing save, you'll need to respec both regular and mythic paths to get full functionality.\n\n### This doesn't work with controllers. You have to use mouse and keyboard.\n\n## How it works\n\nAutomatic Bonus Progression automatically grants stat bonuses usually provided by items which no longer provide them. As a result you are free to equip items based on their special abilities and effects.\n\n*Note: Items in game still list these bonuses in the UI, but they do not apply. I will likely never address this, as it is a huge effort to fix.*\n\n* **Armor Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Armor*\n    * +1 Chainmail\n* **Shield Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Shield*\n    * Armor attunement is lower when a shield is equipped\n* **Weapon Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Weapon*\n    * +1 Greataxe, Amulet of Mighty Fists +1\n* **Off-Hand Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Off-Hand Weapon/Secondary Natural Attacks*\n    * Weapon attunement is lower when dual wielding or using secondary natural attacks\n* **Resistance**: *+X Resistance to Saving Throws*\n    * Cloak of Resistance +1\n* **Deflection**: *+X Deflection to AC*\n    * Ring of Deflection +1\n* **Toughness**: *+X Enhancement to Natural Armor*\n    * e.g. Amulet of Natural Armor +1\n* **Mental Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Mental Ability Score*\n    * Headband of Wisdom +2\n* **Physical Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Physical Ability Score*\n    * Belt of Strength +2\n\n| Level  | Bonus |\n| :----: | ------------- |\n| 3      | +1 Resistance |\n| 4      | +1 Armor<br>+1 Weapon |\n| 5      | +1 Deflection |\n| 6      | +2 Mental Prowess |\n| 7      | +2 Physical Prowess |\n| 8      | +2 Resistance<br>+1 Shield<br>+1 Off-Hand<br>+1 Toughness |\n| 9      | +2 Armor<br>+2 Weapon |\n| 10     | +3 Resistance<br>+2 Deflection |\n| 11     | +4 or +2/+2 Mental Prowess |\n| 12     | +4 or +2/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 13     | +4 Resistance<br>+2 Toughness<br>+4/+2 Mental Prowess<br>+4/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 14     | +5 Resistance<br>+3 Armor, +2 Shield<br>+3 Weapon, +3 Off-Hand |\n| 15     | +4 Armor, +3 Shield<br>+4 Weapon, +3 Off-Hand<br>+6/+2 or +4/+4 Mental Prowess |\n| 16     | +3 Deflection<br>+3 Toughness<br>+6/+2 or +4/+4 Physical Prowess  |\n| 17     | +4 Deflection<br>+4 Tougness<br>+5 Armor<br>+5 Weapon<br>+6/+2/+2 or +4/+4/+2 Mental Prowess<br>+6/+2/+2 or +4/+4/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 18     | +5 Deflection<br>+5 Tougness<br>+6/+4/+2 or +4/+4/+4 Mental Prowess<br>+6/+4/+2 or +4/+4/+4 Physical Prowess |\n| 19     | 3 Legendary Gifts  |\n| 20     | 5 Legendary Gifts  |\n\nMental Prowess and Physical Prowess allow you to select which ability scores to boost. The bonuses you receive are further customizable using Legendary Gifts, detailed below.\n\n![Legendary gifts screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/legendary_gifts.png)\n\nEach Legendary Gift allows you to select a different special bonus. In addition to the Legendary Gifts you receive at level 19 and 20, you receive 2 Legendary Gifts at every Mythic Level for a total of 28. If you are on the Legend path, you receive an additional Legendary Gift at level 22 and every two levels after.\n\n### Legendary Ability\n\nGain a +1 inherent bonus to any ability score. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, and it stacks up to +5 in any one ability score.\n\n### Legendary Prowess\n\nThis allows you to increase the bonuses granted by Physical Prowess or Mental Prowess. You cannot increase the bonus to any single ability score above +6.\n\n### Legendary Shieldmaster\n\nRemoves the armor enhancement bonus penalty applied when using a shield.\n\n### Legendary Twin Weapons\n\nRemoves the weapon enhancement bonus penalty applied when using off-hand or secondary weapons.\n\n### Legendary Enchantments\n\n![Attunement screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/attunement.png)\n\nAllows you to apply enchantments to your equipment (Armor, Shield, Weapon, Off-Hand). Each enchantment has an Enhancement Cost and you can apply enchantments with a total cost equal to your rank in the corresponding feature (max 5).\n\n#### Armor Enchantments\n\n*

    "Description": "The introduction of Backgrounds was a very welcome change from Kingmaker to Wrath of the Righteous. Unfortunately, with the exception of a couple very specific builds they are largely meaningless. This mod seeks to rectify that issue and ensure that Backgrounds which provide meaningful effects to a wide variety of characters are available. This is accomplished through three means:\n<br />\n<br />1. [b]Weapon proficiencies provide trait bonuses instead of enhancement. [/b]By default, characters already proficient in a weapon who select a Background that provides that proficiency receive a +1 Enhancement bonus when utilizing this weapon. This makes no sense, as one's background should not provide the same form of bonus as a magical item. This also stacks with Masterwork weapons because of how the bonuses are coded. Eligible characters now receive a +1 trait bonus when using the correct weapon which should provide a minor but meaningful use for the whole game.\n<br />2. [b]Revamping of pre-existing backgrounds.[/b] Many of the backgrounds have had the skills and proficiencies they provide adjusted - some considerably.\n<br />3. [b]Introduction of new backgrounds.[/b] Three brand new backgrounds (Knight, Skyseeker, and Templar) were created to fill what I felt were clear gaps in the current background array. I hope to add more as needs can be identified and new backgrounds developed to fulfill them.\n<br />\n<br />[i]DISCLAIMER: This mod is not made for installation with the Unity Mod Manager. [/i]Read the installation instructions very carefully. I am not a C# coder, therefore this mod was made utilizing Owlcat's Wrath Modification Template for Unity. Eventually this will be installable through the Steam workshop but until then there's no way around manual installation that I'm aware of.\n<br />\n<br />Modfinder Installation (Preferred Method): Download and install [i]Modfinder [/i]by WittleWolfie at:\n<br />https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder\n<br />Download GreatRadiance, then drag and drop the zip folder onto the \"Drag zips here to install\" block at the bottom of the Modfinder interface.\n<br />\n<br />Manual Installation Instructions:\n<br />1. Navigate to [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/ and create a new folder named 'Modifications'.\n<br />2. Unzip the mod and place the 'BetterBackgrounds' folder and all its contents in there.\n<br />3. Create a file named 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' and place it within [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/    \n<br />*4. Open 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' in notepad and add the modification to it by inputting:\n<br />{\n<br />     \"EnabledModifications\": [\"BetterBackgrounds\"]    \n<br />}\n<br />5. Enjoy! \n<br />\n<br />*If you're running another Unity Mod such as my GreatRadiance mod simultaneously, the syntax looks like this\n<br />{\n<br />      \"EnabledModifications\": [\"BetterBackgrounds\", \"GreatRadiance\"]\n<br />}\n<br />\n<br />If there's a particular background you'd really like to see added, or you think one of the currently implemented backgrounds needs work, please leave your ideas and feedback in the Posts section.\n<br />\n<br />If you enjoy this mod, my other mods are available at the links below:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/143]GreatRadiance[/url] - Makes Radiance a greatsword (or virtually any other weapon)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/134?tab=description]Chrom (Matt Mercer) Voice Pack[/url] - Adds the voice of Chrom from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/223]Lucina Voicepack[/url] - Adds the voice of Lucina from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice",

The mod [b]will[/b] spend the points from your arcane resevoir but does not (currently) predict them like it does spell slots.\n<br />\n<br />If you are using Share Transmutation and there are no points, the spell will be skipped.\n<br />If you are using Powerful Change and there are no points, the spell will be cast without it.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NOTE: The combat log will say these casts are successful, it is a known thing and will get fixed eventually.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to DeadMor0z for the contributions!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />如何使用：在任何能完整操控整个小队的地方，点开法术书右下角进入设置面板，先选择法术，然后在中间选择施法者，中间的右边选择这个施法所在的施法序列，最后在最下方选择施法目标。\n<br />设置好后，在游戏中任何时候点击左下角的三个按钮即可瞬间释放相应序列中所有设置好的法术。\n<br />此mod由1onepower翻译，你可以在 [url=https://space.bilibili.com/383719917?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0]B站[/url] 关注我,并且欢迎加入最大的中文CRPG社区之一：[url=https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E6%8B%A5%E7%8E%8B%E8%80%85&amp;fr=index]拥王者吧[/url]",

Obviously not based in tabletop. Or any strong sense of game balance.\n\nSpecifically adds:\n\nChampion Protection - adds a +1/+2/+3 AC bonus depending on whether you're wearing light, medium, or heavy armour. Scales as you increase in character level, up to +24 AC when wearing Heavy Armour with a level 40 character.\n\nChampion Guard - adds a +5 DR/- bonus. Every 5th level increases it by another +5.\n\nChampion Aim - adds a +1 attack bonus to any weapon. Increases by +2 for every two levels starting at level 3.\n\nChampion Saves - adds +2 per level to all saving throws\n\nChampion Skills - adds a +1 bonus to all skill checks. Increases by +1 for every two levels starting at level 3. This can be toggled to add directly to skill ranks if desired, avoiding issues with untrained skill checks and checks against skill ranks that ignore bonuses.\n\nChampion Strikes - adds +1 damage to any weapon attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at level 4.\n\nChampion Spell Blasts - adds +1 damage to spell attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at caster level 4.\n\nChampion Spell Force - adds +1 to the DCs of your spells. Increases by +1 for every caster level.\n\nChampion Spell Penetration - adds half your caster level to the spell penetration stat of your spells. If you also take the basic Spell Penetration feat, this increases to a full caster level bonus.\n\nYou can adjust whether these should be considered normal feats or Mythic feats if you want to make it a bit harder for you in a playthrough you're using this mod in.\n\nAll Champion feat bonuses can be modified, to not only change the bonus provided but also how many level steps are required per bonus increase i.e. +1 every two levels or +5 every level.\n\n**How to install**\n\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0\n2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n3. Download the Champion Feats mod\n4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n\n**How to build** (updated)\nNow requires you first create an environment variable, called WrathInstallDir, containing the path to the base Wrath folder. All Wrath includes are now relative to that value.\n\n**Thanks**\n\nVek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. \n",

Once you save with this mod enabled it must remain enabled or you will lose access to the save.\n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile a [bug](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [feature request](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D). You can also reach me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) in the #mod-user-general channel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (min v0.23)\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Character Options+\n3. Click \"Install\"\n    * If you don't have [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) already, install them using ModFinder\n\nI also recommend installing [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and [TabletopTweaks-Reworks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Reworks). They are not required but I developed the mod using them and there may bugs if you use it without them.\n\nIf you do not want to use ModFinder, download [CharacterOptionsPlus.*.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/releases/latest) and install it using Unity Mod Manager. Make sure to install [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) as well.\n\n### [Troubleshooting and

Companions get Share Spells\n* Dreadful Carnage requires Furious Focus instead of Dazzling Display\n* Implosion replaces the Tsunami bonus spell granted by the Destruction Domain\n* Only a single Draconic Bloodline can be selected\n* Only a single Elemental Bloodline can be selected\n* The Winter Patron spell list more closely matches the tabletop version\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n* Heavenly Fire can be used 3 + Charisma Modifier times per day instead of just 3\n* Lord Beyond the Grave buff can bet set to permanent, preventing lag / encumberance issues while walking around\n* Serpent's Fang poison DC is calculated correctly\n* Serpent Friend grants +3 to Perception instead of +2, matching the feature description\n* Evasion can be selected as a Slayer's Advanced Talent\n\n## Reporting Problems\n\n### First, go to Settings > Mods > Character Options+ and turn on \"Enable Detailed Logs\"\n\n**Follow this guide: [So you want to report a WotR mod bug?](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/ModBugReports.md)** Ideally include a save file.\n\n1. Use [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) to install [Mewsifer Console](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole) and Mewsifer Console Menu\n2. Reproduce the issue in-game\n3. Open Settings > Mods > Mewsifer Console and select \"Mod Bug Report\"\n    * ![Mewsifer Console Menu screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/bug_report.png)\n4. File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) and attach the generated bug report\n5. Include your save file in the bug report\n    * Saves are stored in `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous\\Saved Games`\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* [Some buffs do not work with BubbleBuffs](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/76)\n    * Also AoE indicators are not enabled in BubbleTweaks by default\n* Winter Witch's Frozen Caress hex does not apply DC increases from things like Elemental Focus; this will probably never be fixed. It does apply the bonus from Winter Witch's Ice Magic.\n\n### Mod Options\n\n![Mod options screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/settings.png)\n\nThis mod uses [Mod Menu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu), settings are in the game settings: Settings > Mods > Character Options+. They are not available in UMM.\n\nAll settings changes require a restart to take effect.\n\nYou can use options to disable any feature added. This will:\n\n* Prevent the feature from being selectable\n* Remove any effect from the feature\n* Remove any changes to existing mechanics\n\nThis will not:\n\n* Remove the feature from characters (but it will not work)\n* Grant a replacement feature for characters who have it\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Bubbles (factsubio) for [BubblePrints](https://github.com/factubsio/BubblePrints), saving me from going mad.\n* Vek17 for [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core), so I don't have to distribute my transpilers.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n### Localization\n\n* Kurufinve - Russian\n* 呶呶BOT - Chinese\n* jofrancose - Spanish (Machine Translation)\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat).\n",

    "Description": "# Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters\n\nMy continuation of [Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/40)\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download (**Install only one, not both**):  \n- ### Latest version. Requires [ModMenu](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/releases).  \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/latest)\n\n- ### Old version without ModMenu dependency   \nIn case you don't want to install ModMenu. Less functions, but deals with crusade the same.    \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/download/1.3.1/CombatRelief-1.3.1.zip)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Remove 1.2.1 version of Combat Relief if you have it.\n3. Install ModMenu.\n4. Install this mod.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- ### Autowin of crusade battles  \nCrusaders' armies always win autoresolve. Don't forget to enable crusade setting \"Run the tactical combat automatically\".\n\n- ### Avoid random encounters   \nMakes your party always avoid random encounters. Story encounters during travel are unaffected by the mod.\n\n- ### Prevent Corruption  \nWhen enabled corruption is not gained during rest.\n\n- ### Skill roll modification (version 2.1.0+)\nAllows to set on each skill if you want to roll normally/take 10/take 20.  \nCan be set to work out of combat only.\nDisabled by default.\n\n- ### Teleport to skeleton mechant button (version 2.2.0+)\nTeleports you to skeleton merchant random encounter area.\nHas a check for game being main campaign, but other than that will teleport out of any situation and act. Don't use it to get there when you're not supposed to.   \nSo to be safe use it only when you're on global map.\n\n## Settings\n\nAny and all functions can be disabled in Options -> Mods -> CombatRelief. (Or in UMM if you're on version 1.3.1)    \nBy default all functions are enabled.   \nSettings can be save-specific. Meaning if you change them in loaded game, that will affect only this save. If you change them while in Main Menu, that's sets default for all saves where they are not overwritten by save-specific settings.     \nSettings affect game immediately, no restart is required.\n\n## Credits\n\nBtB/streikeferret - original Combat Relief mod creator\n\nPermission from him:\n\n> Anyone who wants to continue this mod is free to reverse engineer my existing DLLs.",

It's still very unfinished though if people enjoy it, perhaps more work can be put into the mod. There are certain feats that don't apply to the Demon Summoning itself, like Added Summons and Superior Summoning. For some reason, it doesn't recognize those feats and won't add additional summons. Keep in mind as well, this mod is not about balance, its a power fantasy. You are the main character of the game, it all revolves around you. Take that to heart and use your summoning abilities as much or as little as you want, finally you can summon like the game revolves around you. Will require Toybox in order take direct control of your summons.\n<br />\n<br />From level 1 you can summon demons if you take the feat : Apprentice Demonology. This ability expands and changes as you level, from Demonic Art 1 at 1st level, Demonic Art 2 at 3rd level, and Demonic art 3 at 5th level. Each Art unlocks more demons, and turns attempts to summon previous lower level demons into summoning multiples.\n<br />\n<br />This is how progression works, each of the creatures you can summon is based on their CR. Its designed so that, each summon you can use can be actually useful in the setting in which you find yourself. By the end of the game normally, you can summon a Balor for example at the end of the Demon Mythic Path. Big whoop, a Balor at that point in the game is entirely pointless and inconsequential to everything going on. Here, every summon you get should have a big impact on the current area of the game at the current level you are. I find that a lot of these are ever so slightly balanced by the fact the demons you're summoning are fighting other demons more often than not, having to hit through high AC's and damage reduction. \n<br />\n<br />There are also 2 additional powerful feats you can take to further power up your demons. Improved Augment Summoning, and Greater Augment Summoning. Improved gives a +8 Profane bonus to STR, DEX, CON, and a +4 bonus to AC, Attack bonus, all saving throws, and immunity to fear for all your summoned creatures. Greater increases that to +12 for stats, and +6 to AC, AB, all saving throws. These feats are really your only shot at having these summons be able to somewhat stand their ground against endgame mythic demons.\n<br />\n<br />All summons last 1 minute per character level, and you use each ability per day equal to your charisma modifier, to a minimum of 1. There is no summoning limit.\n<br />\n<br />Progression :\n<br />\n<br />Level 1 - Access to Apprentice Demonology\n<br />\n<br />Demonic Art 1 - Summon 1 Dretch, Cambion, or Quasit.\n<br />\n<br />Level 3 - Upgrades to Demonic Art 2 - Summon 1 Vermlek, Abricandiul, or Shir, or 1d3 of the previous level.\n<br />\n<br />Level 5 - Upgrades to Demonic Art 3 - Summon 1 Brimorak, Incubus, or Babau, 1d3 of DA2, or 1d4+! of DA1.\n<br />\n<br />It should be noted here you keep DA3 as a permanent ability. DA4 is a seperate ability.\n<br />\n<br />Level 7 : Access to Adept Demonology.\n<br />\n<br />Demonic Art 4 - Summon 1 Shadow Demon, Succubus, Nabasu, or Vrock, 1d3 of DA3, or 1d4+1 of DA2\n<br />\n<br />Level 9 - Upgrades to Demonic Art 5 - Summon 1 Derakni, Kalavakus, Gibrileth, or Retriever, 1d3 DA4, 1d4+1 DA3, loses access DA2 Summons.\n<br />\n<br />Level 11 - Upgrades to Demonic Art 6 - Summon 1 Coloxus, Omox, Glabrezu, Oolioddroo, Nalfeshnee, or Painajai, 1d3 DA5, or 1d4+1 DA4. Loses DA3\n<br />\n<br />This is a seperate ability from DA7 and DA3.\n<br />\n<br />Level 13 - Access to Master Demonology\n<br />\n<br />Demonic Art 7 - Summon 1 Marileth, Lilitu, or Vavakia, 1d3 of DA6, or 1d4+1 of DA5\n<br />\n<br />Level 15 - Demonic Art 8 - Summon 1 Balor, Gallu, or Vrolikai, 1d3 DA7, 1d4 DA6, Loses DA5\n<br />\n<br />Level 17 - Serperate Ability Demonic Art 9 - 1d3 Balor, Gallu, or Vrolikai, 1d4 DA8\n<br />\n<br />Use the summons how you like, even though you have access to them all, perhaps you're RPing a Demon worshipper and only have access to specific types.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, a big thanks to 2 modders than helped me a lot. Perunq, whom I commissioned to create the mod, and then a few years later when I desired to play again, Microsoftenator who kindly updated the mod and will work on possible bug fixes. Without them this mod wouldn't have been possible. Cheers and enjoy!",

    "Description": "# Ebon's Content Mod\nThis mod was created to add new content from tabletop to Wrath of the Righteous that wasn't represented in the other major content mods. This requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core \"TabletopTweaks-Core\"), [WrathPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/WrathPatches \"WrathPatches\") (I'm not entirely sure why, but Micro says it does, so it does), and is partially dependent upon [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base \"TabletopTweaks-Base\"), though it will work without it.\n\nIf you want to read through my rationale for any implementation decisions I had to make along the way, please see my [Modder Notes](https://github.com/EdgarEbonfowl/EbonsContentMod/blob/main/ModderNotes.md \"Modder Notes\").\n\n## Added Races\nThis mod adds the following races to the game and they should work like the default races. Note, I have not completed a playthrough with these races, so I cannot say for sure that you will not encounter problems. You may experience some strange behavior, especially in dialog, where the race type either is not recognized or, more likely, is recognized as some other race (an NPC calling your drow character an elf, for instnace). That being said, if you encounter bugs, please report them!\n\n**If you don't see your favorite race here:** the way I do races involves cloning, recoloring, and then cobbling together base game assets (think Mr. Potatohead plus a paint brush), so only races that can be made from vanilla assets are included here. That means no tengu, no catfolk, etc. If you want me to make a race that would look acceptable with vanilla assets let me know OR if you have some 3D modeling skills and want to submit custom assets, I can make your race. Currently, only the goblin is using anything custom.\n\n**Note on colors:** the method I use to add custom color textures to the game causes my custom color ramps for skin color, eye color, hair color, etc. to not show their color swatch in the character creator, showing up as empty circles instead. I promise, they still work, just click through them and you will see.\n\n- [Sylph](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-sylph/ \"Sylph\")\n- [Undine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-undine/ \"Undine\")\n- [Duergar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-duergar/ \"Duergar\")\n- [Svirfneblin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-svirfneblin/ \"Svirfneblin\")\n- [Samsaran](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-samsaran/ \"Samsaran\")\n- [Strix](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-strix/ \"Strix\")\n- [Ifrit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-ifrit/ \"Ifrit\")\n- [Suli](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-suli/ \"Suli\")\n- [Fetchling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-fetchling/ \"Fetchling\")\n- [Drow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow/ \"Drow\")\n- [Changeling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-changeling/ \"Changeling\")\n  - Should be female only.

You only can pick one, so choose wisely. You must have TabletopTweaks-Base installed for this feature to take effect. The discoveries that are based on spell school are really only useful for the School Savant archetype which is added by [HomebrewArchetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/279 \"HomebrewArchetypes\"). Integrated arcane discoveries:\n  - [Alchemical Affinity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/alchemical-affinity/ \"Alchemical Affinity\")\n  - [Faith Magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/faith-magic/ \"Faith Magic\")\n  - [Idealize](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/idealize-su/ \"Idealize\")\n  - [Knowledge Is Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/knowledge-is-power-ex/ \"Knowledge Is Power\")\n  - [Opposition Research](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/opposition-research/ \"Opposition Research\")\n  - [Yuelral's Blessing](https://aonprd.com/WizardArcaneDiscoveries.aspx \"Yuelral's Blessing\")\n  - If you have [MysticalMayhem](https://gitgud.io/Kreaddy/mysticalmayhem \"MysticalMayhem\") the following arcane discoveries are also added:\n    - School Expertise - this is homebrew, but not anything crazy so I added it\n    - [Staff-Like Wand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/staff-like-wand/ \"Staff-Like Wand\")\n   \n## Ability Fixes\n- **Come And Get Me!** barbarian power now works correctly with the skald's raging song. The vanilla version only affected the skald, not teammates. It will be disabled any time a teammate steps out of the song's aura then steps back in, so be aware of that.\n- **Discordant Voice** feat now applies to any ally within the area of effect of any bard song rather than just the beneficial ones.\n\n## Mechanics Fixes/Changes\n- Multi-projectile spells (Hellfire Ray, Scorching Ray, etc.) that should be able to assign projectiles to different targets per tabletop rules will now switch to a new target if the current target dies, rather than just dumping all the extra projectiles into the first target's corpse. All tabletop targeting rules are respected - for instance, no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart for Hellfire Ray. There was some early inconsistency here, but I think I have corrected any flaws in the implementation and my current testing seems to indicate that this consistently works as intended - please submit an issue report if you find otherwise.\n\n## Installation\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).\n2. Drop the zip file from the relaease into the \"Drop Zip Files Here\" panel in the Unity Mod Manager UI in the \"Mods\" tab.\n\n**Note:** This requires the Doorstop installation method for Unity Mod Manager, most people do it this way, but if yours is installed using the Assembly method you can do one of these (you can see which method you used at the bottom of the \"Install\" tab):\n1. Uninstall UMM and reinstall using the Doorstop method\n2. Use WrathPatches to upgrade the game's Harmony version\n3. Copy `Harmony` from `Wrath_Data\\Managed\\UnityModManager` to `Wrath_Data\\Managed`\n\n## Other Mods\n* This version will not play nice with Worldcrawl. If you use that mod, I have released a Worldcrawl-compatible version over on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/758?tab=files \"Nexus Mods\"). The Worldcrawl version does not have the Collegiate Initiate archetype, but is otherwise unchanged. I will work on a solution that preserves the archetype, but for now, use that version if you use Worldcrawl.\n* The cloned parts created for the new races will not show up as editable options in Visual Adjustments 2. Everything else still will work fine. Maybe one day there will be a meeting of the minds to sort this issue out, but for now, know that is a limitation.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n* WittleWolfie for [BlueprintCore](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core/tree/main), an API that really speeds up the process.\n* DarthParametric for contributing the custom assets for the goblin model, generally giving me a lot of help, and having a cool screen name.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat), especially Micro who has helped me a ton even if his code is too complex to be human-readable.\n",

    "Description": "# Ebon's Unfixer Mod\nIf you're like me and you have been playing Wrath of the Righteous for a couple years off-and-on and each time you return to the game you find out Owlcat \"fixed\" a feature that you built around and now your characters are markedly worse, this mod is for you. The intent of this mod is merely to revert/unfix some of the fixes that Owlcat implemented since launch which haven't been reverted elsewhere. This requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core \"TabletopTweaks-Core\").\n\n## The Unfixes\n* **Critical Threat Range Calculation:** the way threat range is calculated is restored to the glorious time before the recent patch that \"fixed\" it. Gravesinger? Great again. Trickster critical feats? Great again.\n* **Bane Of Spirit:** remember when the Bane of Spirit ring allowed you to change any ally's damage into force damage with a free action? Do you hate that it got made into a swift action ability? Well now it is a free action again! Not a full revert to when it made *everything* into force damage (infinite force damage cave fangs anyone?), but a big step in that direction.\n* **Shatter Defenses:** the intimidation melee ability *par excellence* before it got \"fixed\" and actually required you to hit the target before making them flat-footed. Now it checks for shaken/frightened before the attack roll again. Beautiful.\n* **Wide Sweep:** the quintessential crowd killer before Owlcat \"fixed\" it, changing its AOE weapon damage to 2d4 damage. Well, now it's back to the glory days of exploding throngs of hapless kobolds with cleave/cleaving finish so you can channel your inner grim reaper.\n* **Repurpose:** the mythic spell that made the lich feel like the master of undeath used to be worthwhile on higher difficulties before it was \"fixed.\" Now, Repurpose preserves the difficulty-specific bonuses on your raised undead minions once again.\n\n## Installation\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).\n2.

    "Description": "# Enduring rework - mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nChanges Enduring spells and Greater Enduring Spells mythic abilities to be the following\n\nEnduring Spells\n```\nPrerequisite: Metamagic (Extend Spell)\n\nYou've learned a way to prolong the effects of your beneficial extended spells\n\nBenefit: \nEffects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic applied that should last longer than 1 minute but shorter than 10 minutes last 10 minutes.\nEffects that should last longer than 10 minutes but shorter than 1 hour last 1 hour.\n```\n\nGreater Enduring Spells\n```\nYou've mastered a way to prolong your beneficial spells.\n\nBenefit: \nIn addition to existing benefits effects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic that should last longer than an hour are permanent.\n```\n\n### Note:\n**Unlike base game where \"longer than X\" is \"longer or equal\" here it's actually longer as written.**\n\nSo 1 minute extended spell will stay 1 minute. 1 minute 12 seconds will become 10 minutes.\n\nCave Fangs, Call Lightning, Call Lightning Storm won't become permanent. Sorry if you already theorized this.\n\nDoes not introduce save dependency, so you can remove it any time.\n\nIf used together with Tabletop-Reworks, it will overwrite TT-Reworks changes to Enduring Spells.

    "Description": "This is a mod to add additional slides to the epilogue for Wrath of The Righteous based on a plurality of quests and NPCs that do not have slides in the vanilla game. The mod has two \"modes.\" In the first mode (Integrated), the slides will appear between existing slides. In the second mode (Extra Slides), the slides will appear at the end of the vanilla slides. Integrated mode additionally will add some alterations to existing slides, mostly related to giving additional reactivity to companions in the secret ending. You select the mode you want to use via answers during the epilogue. You can activate Integrated mode on the first slide. You can activate Extra Slides mode (or choose to not see the epilogue expansion) on a new slide that appears after the companion section.\n<br />\n<br />Be aware that this mod adds a LOT of new slides. Checking with some of the tools I use for datamining indicates that I have added 235+ potential slides with 1225+ lines between those new slides. It is impossible to trigger everything in a single play through and some of them will replace existing slides, but 50%+ of the slides might be possible in a completionist run. For comparison, by my count there are 101 slides (81 normal end, 20 Aeon end) in the base game v. 2.1. So this mod will triple the number of available slides.\n<br />\n<br />A complete list of the new slides and their requirements can be found at the following locations:\n<br />[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/15bcvz6/expanded_epilogue_mod_slide_guide_part_1/]Reddit, Part 1[/url], has spoiler tags\n<br />[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/15he5gh/expanded_epilogue_mod_slide_guide_part_2/]Reddit, Part 2[/url], has spoiler tags\n<br />[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiST8ZFFqmRAFXgv6sSgZC9brWsRBtU3MzKk0A2HmYI/edit?usp=sharing]Google Docs[/url], does not have spoiler tags\n<br />\n<br />Most recent tested version: 2.6.0n (everything appears to be working)\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW TO INSTALL[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)\n<br />2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n<br />3. Download the Expanded Epilogue Mod\n<br />4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab or unzip the zip and move the Epilogue folder into the Mods folder in the Wrath root directory\n<br />\n<br />[b]MOD VERSION HISTORY[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.3.0 - Russian translation added. Added a blank line at the end of each slide (including base game) to prevent letters like 'j' from being cut off. Fixed conditions related to Lathimas and Harmattan. Tweaked the conditions for Through the Ashes slides, which I think should allow it to identify imported states where all the survivors died (triggers on DLC2_LowFantasy)\n<br />1.2.3 - Improved conditions for Liotr's slide. Changed references to Dracoliches to Raveners since Raveners are the Pathfinder counterpart. Changed the conditions on some Logistics slides to catch a scenario where you used Toybox to sequence break. Added a condition on Camellia's abandon Aeon slide so you need to complete her Chapter 4 quest to get the good variant. Minor tweak to Lann and Wenduag logic for secret reasons. Did some code tweaks to clean out stupid warnings about failed validation. Apparently the evaluators wanted names. &gt;.&gt;\n<br />1.2.2 - Update to the conditions for slides for party members that leave the party so the slides are also triggered when they leave Legends that revert to their old Mythic Paths. Corrected an error that could cause Sendri's slide to trigger when it shouldn't.\n<br />1.2.1 - Update to the conditions for the Pleasure Slave slide as it wasn't working right. Also improved detection for Kyado dying off screen in Chapter 5.\n<br />1.2.0 - Update for version 2.3, adds four new slides for the update including the Black Blade, adds additional variants for Lann and Arue keyed off of DLC variables, and adds a new slide for an Eidolon if you are playing as a Summoner (mod only). Additionally, added images for a few characters that were lacking full sized versions (see known issues). Finally, fixed a minor issue where importing from DLC5 was causing the DLC2 survivors are dead slides that was introduced in a previous WotR update.\n<br />1.1.0 - Update for version 2.2, adds 10 new slides including Bismuth, the three new \"animal companions,\" and DLC5 story specific slides.\n<br />1.0.0 - Full release on Nexus. Tested on 2.1.4v\n<br />0.1.0 - Beta release for code testing. Editing process is still ongoing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]KNOWN ISSUES[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The horse, ghost horse, blizzard elemental, night hag \"animal companion,\" Hippogriff, Sithhud, Razmir, and Black Blade character portraits have no full sized version of their portraits in the files. After testing, I've decided to use their half-sized portraits because I think they look fine and a slightly stretched picture is better than no picture. If you are sensitive to pixilation, I'm sorry. Note: The Black Blade only has a small portrait, so it is stretched a bit more than the others.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MOD COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Expanded Epilogue should be compatible with nearly all mechanic focused mods. If someone someday makes a mod that adds a Mythic Path, that could potentially cause major compatibility issues. Hypothetically, minor issues could also arise if a mod were to add new versions of any of the items that are checked for (e.g., the crusade relics), but at most that should just result in a slide being skipped.\n<br />\n<br />Story expansion mods should all play nice with Extra Slides mode as it has a minimal footprint. Integrated mode will not show any newly added slides from other mods unless compatibility has been added. Currently I have added compatibility so that slides from the Woljiff Romance Mod and the Camellia Romance Expanded End will show if the corresponding mods are installed.

Supports up to 24 party members, including pets (double the provision of vanilla).\n\nBy default, the game only handles up to 12 entities in a party formation. Anything beyond that and characters are forced into the same position on top of one another. This mod edits all the custom formations to allow for more characters, adding an additional 12 positions to bring the total to 24. It also adjusts the scaling of the character portraits in the formation manager UI to allow for more space to fit larger parties. Additionally, the settings of the Auto formation have been tweaked to try and better accommodate large parties, and maximise the use of the UI space for it in the formation manager.\n\n## Install\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) and set it up for WOTR (\"Pathfinder Second Adventure\").\n1. Download the latest version of the mod from [Github](https://github.com/DarthParametric/WOTR_Formation_Fixer/releases/latest), [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/836), or via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n1. Install the mod manually, via UMM, or via ModFinder.\n1. Run your game.\n\n## Notes\n- More Party Slots is not strictly required, but there's little point in using this mod unless you have a party beyond the vanilla 6. Although it may prove useful for vanilla 6 + 6 pets.\n- If you _are_ using More Party Slots, the use of [More Party View Slots](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/692) is also recommended.\n- The vanilla game has a hard limit of 20 units in the party, which this mod has expanded to 24. While More Party Slots might let you add more units beyond that, doing so will cause the game to crash when loading an area with all of them in the party. While the cap itself is easy to raise, each new party member would require a new set of formation positions.\n- The formation manager UI scaling has been adjusted to fit larger formations more comfortably and give you more room to customise their positions. The various patches involved to do so though may cause some unexpected wonkiness, so use the Restore to Default button if things get messed up.\n- The Auto formation does not handle large parties very well. I have tried to adjust its behaviour, with limited success. However, the formation manager UI tab for it does now dynamically adjust the formation position to try and maximise the available space.\n- Should work with both the keyboard/mouse and controller UI schemes.\n\n## Thanks & Acknowledgements\n- microsoftenator2022 - Helped out with creating the first transpiler (which I subsequently rewrote, so all terrible code and bugs are my fault) and corrected some of my syntax goofs. He also pointed out where the game was capping the max formation array size, leading to crashes.\n- ADDB - Provided the postfix patch for scaling the usable area of the formation grid back up to the correct size after other UI scaling.\n- Everyone in the `#mod-dev-technical` channel of the Owlcat Discord server for various modding-related discussions and suggestions, help troubleshooting issues, and answering general questions.\n",

A spellcasting Commander also has a different line after the sparring match.\n[Lann romance: chapter 1] Changed his closing line for active romance (originally introduced in 0.9.5) in chapter 1, so he does not start simping after the Commander if she flirted with him ONCE."

    "Description": "[b]GreatRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Availability of unique magical weapons is largely restricted to either longswords or one of the weird exotic weapons like sai's which literally no one wants to use but the game is covered with. There are probably about 20 different named longswords in the game, to maybe 3-4 decent greatswords, arguably the most popular weapon for front-line martials in Pathfinder. And of course, the legendary Paladin weapon that plays a special role in the entire adventure...is also a longsword, because why make anyone want to actually use one of those 20 other ones?\n<br />\n<br />If you're like me you were profoundly disappointed when you discovered that the game would force you to choose between playing with the weapon you wanted to or having to pass the game's iconic sword to a companion. Especially since in the Adventure Path on which this is based, Radiance is actually supposed to transform into a Paladin's preferred weapon. This mod is my attempt to remedy that. [b]GreatRadiance[/b] changes all versions of Radiance into a greatsword, and gives all magical versions of it the Evil Outsider Bane enchantment for good measure, to make up for the inability to enchant weapons and the absence of the 'Oath of the Crusade' archetype.\n<br />\n<br />[i][b]DISCLAIMER: [/b]This mod is not made for installation with the Unity Mod Manager. [/i]Read the installation instructions very carefully. I am not a C# coder, therefore this mod was made utilizing Owlcat's Wrath Modification Template for Unity. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Modfinder Installation (Preferred Method): [/b]Download and install [i]Modfinder [/i]by WittleWolfie at:\n<br />https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder\n<br />Download GreatRadiance, then drag and drop the zip folder onto the \"Drag zips here to install\" block at the bottom of the Modfinder interface.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Manual Installation Instructions:\n<br />*[i]A thorough installation manual in pdf format with extensive screenshot clarification is now available in the 'Files'  section under 'Miscellaneous'.[/i]\n<br />1.[/b] Navigate to [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/ and create a new folder named 'Modifications'. \n<br />[b]2.[/b] Unzip the mod and place the 'GreatRadiance' folder and all its contents in there.\n<br />[b]3.[/b] Create a file named 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' and place it within [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/   [b]\n<br />[/b][b]*4. [/b]Open 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' in notepad and add the modification to it by inputting:\n<br />{\n<br />     \"EnabledModifications\": [\"GreatRadiance\"]    \n<br />}\n<br />[b]5.[/b] Obtain Radiance, either by playing until you find it or loading up a game in which you've already gotten it.\n<br />[b]6. [/b]Enjoy! \n<br />\n<br />*If you're running another Unity-developed Mod such as my BetterBackgrounds mod simultaneously, the syntax looks like this\n<br />{\n<br />      \"EnabledModifications\": [\"BetterBackgrounds\", \"GreatRadiance\"]\n<br />}\n<br />\n<br />[b]Alternate Versions:\n<br />[/b]There are numerous alternate versions of GreatRadiance available as optional files which replace Radiance with weapons other than Greatsword. Installation is identical. It is [b]not[/b] possible to run multiple versions of this Mod at the same time. That said, it is simply a matter of swapping out the GreatRadiance folder in the Modifications folder to change between versions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bastard Sword[/b] - IllegitimateRadiance\n<br />[b]Dagger[/b] - StabbityRadiance\n<br />[b]*Double Axe[/b] - OrcRadiance\n<br />[b]Dueling Sword[/b] - AldoriRadiance\n<br />[b]Dwarven Waraxe[/b] - GimliRadiance\n<br />[b]Earthbreaker [/b]-[b] [/b]SmashRadiance\n<br />[b]Elven Curve Blade [/b]-[b] [/b]CurvedRadiance\n<br />[b]Estoc[/b] - MatadorRadiance\n<br />[b]Falcata [/b]- AerekostesRadiance\n<br />[b]Falchion [/b]- CritRadiance\n<br />[b]Fauchard[/b] - GuanRadiance\n<br />[b]Glaive [/b]-[b] [/b]PoeticRadiance\n<br />[b]Greataxe[/b] - BarbaricRadiance\n<br />[b]Handaxe[/b] - HatchetRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Flail [/b]-[b] [/b]AkkhanRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Mace[/b] - MolagRadiance\n<br />[b]Kukri [/b]- NokRadiance\n<br />[b]Longbow[/b] - HunterRadiance\n<br />[b]Longspear[/b] - KnightlyRadiance\n<br />[b]Quarterstaff [/b]- StickRadiance\n<br />[b]Rapier [/b]- PointyRadiance\n<br />[b]Scimitar[/b] - DrizztRadiance\n<br />[b]Scythe [/b]- LichRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortspear [/b]- SpartanRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortsword[/b] - LesserRadiance\n<br />[b]Staffsling [/b]- KenderRadiance\n<br />[b]Starknife[/b] - StarRadiance\n<br />[b]Throwing Axe[/b] - ChuckRadiance\n<br />[b]Trident[/b] - TritonRadiance\n<br />[b]*Two-bladed Sword[/b] - RoninRadiance\n<br />[b]Warhammer[/b] - ToragRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[b]*[/b]If you convert Radiance to a double weapon, then load up a saved game that already has Radiance and has it equipped on a character, it will break your inventory. You'll need to use Toybox to remove the item altogether, then re-add it and equip it properly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n<br />Q: [/b]Help! I've followed the instructions but nothing happened - Radiance is still a longsword.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Doublecheck the 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings' file you created. Ensuring that file extensions are turned on, is the full name with extensions 'OwlcatModificationManangerSettings.json.txt'? If so, eliminate the '.txt' and that should fix the problem. If it's still not working, hit me up in the comments or over DM and I'll help you troubleshoot.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]My game isn't starting.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]There is almost a 100% chance other mods are at fault here. The most common cause until recently was a conflict between AutoBuff and TableTopTweaks.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]What about Natural Attacks/Unarmed Strikes?\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Unfortunately this is something I just can't figure out how to do right now. I do genuinely want to bring the option to use Radiance to monks, Paladins of Irori, and the like but it's just not within my ability at the moment. Rest assured I *will* make this option if and when that changes.\n<br />\n<br />If you enjoy this mod, my other mods are available at the links below:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/205]Better Backgrounds[/url] - Revamps the existing backgrounds and adds new ones to ensure background selection is meaningful for all characters\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/134?tab=description]Chrom (Matt Mercer) Voice Pack[/url] - Adds the voice of Chrom from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/223]Lucina Voicepack[/url] - Adds the voice of Lucina from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice",

          "Changelog": "This is V3 release along with a release on Nexus.\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/734\nI am hoping since John made the mod open source MIT they won't take it down since John is not supporting the original mod anymore and can't be reached via messaging. Some of these changes might be controversial as I attempted to balance certain aspects. This update probably includes a good 20-40 hours of browsing through code and making several changes. I need to rework the way certain things are implemented and potentially build up a base framework that will make things easier going forward for some of the changes I have planned.\n\nReworked Features\nOverpowered Abilities\n\n    Beta Strike: Removed -4 penalty; now offers clean offensive bonuses.\n    Instakill: DC scales with level; failure stuns targets for 1 round.\n    Mind Control: Limited uses per day, scaling from 1/day to 5/day by level 20.\n    Unlimited Power: Restores spell slots only; uses scale from 1 at level 1 to 5 at level 20.\n    Supreme Being: Provides +5 to all stats initially, scaling +1 per 2 levels and +1 per Mythic Rank.\n    Training Montage: Scales from +1 to all stats at level 2 to +5 at level 20.\n    Merchant's Gamble (Replaces Dupe Gold): A thematic rework where investments and strategic choices yield periodic bursts of wealth instead of infinite gold. This adds a narrative-friendly mechanic tied to the protagonist's resourcefulness.\n\nUnderpowered Abilities\n\nNew abilities offer more modest but flavorful enhancements:\nI plan to add another 3 - 9 underpowered abilities that can go together in themes for various playthrough's along with new Archetypes\n    Dodge Master: +4 AC dodge bonus; immune to attacks of opportunity.\n    Super Strength: +50 HP and +4 Strength.\n    Thought Master: +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, and bonuses to Arcana, World, and Perception.\n\nHax Abilities\n    Ascension: +20 to all stats (or +15 for balance, depending on community feedback).\n   I am currently looking at rebalancing the other Hax abilities to add modifiers instead of just straight-up miss, invincibility, or kill mechanic.\n\nClass Updates\n\n    Isekai Protagonist\n        Enhanced scaling and feature progression.\n        Updated spellbook merging functionality for compatibility with other mods.\n\n    Archetype Improvements\n        Reworked Hero and Edge Lord archetypes for thematic consistency.\n        Balanced God Emperor and Mastermind archetypes to ensure competitive utility.\n\nNew Planned Features\n\n    Thematic Pets & Companions\n        Additions like Guardian Angels, Guardian Shinigamis, and other lore-inspired companions.\n\n    Expanded Dialogue & Storyline\n        A full narrative overhaul to provide a deeper, more engaging Isekai experience.\n\n    Unique Gameplay Features\n        Additional abilities and mechanics to enhance immersion and gameplay depth.\n\n    New Mini-Storyline\n        Discover more about the God who reincarnated you and play through a storyline to perhaps gain more power or suffer a TPK who knows.\n        \n        New Archetypes:\n        Currently working on new archetypes that could emulate different strategies or powers from different Anime's, specifically Shonen and power fantasy.\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\n    Implement community-driven updates and feature requests.\n    Continue rebalancing and expanding narrative elements.\n    Develop thematic endgame content to reflect true Isekai dominance."

    "Description": "# KineticArchetypes\nA mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, focused on making more kineticist archetypes and other class archetypes that use kinetic blasts.\n\n# How to install\n\nThis mod is available in ModFinder. Alternatively, you can download the zip file in the [releases page](https://github.com/NosVladimir/KineticArchetypes/releases/) and drag it into ModFinder or UnityModManager.\n\n# Cross-mod compatibility\n\nShould be compatible with DarkCodex and KineticistElementsExpanded.\n\n# Contents\n### Fixes\nFixed the problem where taking burn from a kinetic blade would deactivate the blade after the first attack due to insufficient remaining burn. Kinetic blades now only deactivate if there is indeed no burn left for an attack, either at the start of a round, or during a round immediately after an attack command is issued.\n\n### General\nAdded an ability to allow for remembering a currently held weapon, so that when kinetic blades are formed, the remembered weapon's shape is used instead of a never-changing scimitar. This works the same way as the base game transmog system with the golem, but any visual effect coming from the remembered weapon's enchants sometimes appears sometimes not. I have no idea how to fix that.\n\nAdded infusion [Vital Blade](https://libraryofmetzofitz.fandom.com/wiki/Kinetic_Blade#VITAL_BLADE) that allows kinetic blades to work with vital strike and improved vital strike.\n\nAdded back the supercharge feature for the DLC archetype Kinetic Sharpshooter. Although this functionally doesn't change anything for sharpshooter due to them not being able to gather power, by adding back supercharge it is therefore possible to multi-archetype sharpshooter with the Onslaught Blaster archetype of this mod.\n\n### [Kinetic Duelist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-duelist/)\n\nA kineticist archetype that allows legit two-weapon fighting with kinetic blades. Heavily homebrewed since gaining dual blades at 17th level is not very appealing.\n- Cannot choose form infusions that are >1st level and do not list kinetic blade as prerequisite\n- No infusions at 3rd and 9th levels, no supercharge, no metakinesis quicken\n- 0 burn kinetic blade at 1st level, can AoO\n- Off-hand kinetic blade at 3rd level, more attacks with it at 9th and 15th level\n- Recovers 1 burn in a burn-accepted round on first hit in a full-attack with kinetic blades from 11th level\n- Kinetic assault special charge. 3 burn, attacks with both blades and auto maximise\n\n### [Cinder Adept](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/cinder-adept-kineticist-archetype/)\n\nFire-focused kineticist with a horse.\n- Must choose fire as primary and secondary element. Can still choose a different third element (in base game there is no benefit of choosing the same element except for the composite blast, so the third element is not restricted)\n- Trades 1st level infusion for Mounted Combat bonus feat \n- Trades 4th, 8th, 12th wild talents for a horse animal companion at level -3\n\n### Esoteric Blade\nA homebrew fighter archetype that has access to an energy kinetic blade, can make AoOs with it and use it for Cleaving Finishes and Vital Strikes.\n- Trades 1st level combat feat for a full-progression simple energy kinetic blade, and Str modifier for KB damage\n- Can multiclass with proper kineticist, adds up kinetic blast damage progression but reverts KB damage modifier to conform kineticist main stat (Con/Int/Wis/Cha)\n- Trades 4th level combat feat for KB AoO and KB combat feats including all Cleaving Finishes and all Vital Strikes\n- Trades weapon training 1/2/3/4 for weapon training (kinetic blade). Retains additional weapon type choices and advanced weapon training options. Works with anything dependent on weapon training, e.g. golves of dueling, all advanced weapon training features and Sohei's flurry\n- Trades 10th and 20th level combat feats for changing KB critical range and multiplier to be the same as remembered weapon's base type stats (see above for remembering a weapon). This doesn't account for weapon crit enchants\n\n### [Kinetic Lancer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-lancer/)\nUsing kinetic spear, leaping around the battlefield to full-attack foes.\n- Trades 1st level infusion for a 0 burn kinetic blade and the ability to [jump](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Acrobatics/#jumping-and-falling)\n- Signature ability: Dragoon Dive, leaping to a target and making a kinetic blade attack, with gather power during jumping. Trades some wilds talents and infusions to enhance Dragoon Dive, including lower jump DC, jumping full-attack, higher gather power burn reduction, extra attack, and bonus damage  \n- Trades 5th level infusion for Kinetic Spear, a longspear-shaped kinetic blade with reach and crit range 19-20\n- Trades 9th level infusion for impaling the target of Dragoon Dive, denying their standard actions\n\n### [Onslaught Blaster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/onslaught-blaster/)\nConvert every single dice increase of kinetic blasts into an additional blast fired. Also works with AOE form infusions. **WARNING:** be careful when firing a lot of AOE form infusions, as it will likely cause frame rate drops for a short moment due to too much FX.\n- For every 1d6 damage increase of a normal blast (or every 2d6 for composites), convert it into one more blast fired at 1d6 (or 2d6), except for kinetic blades and wall/cloud/deadly ground\n- Has an automatic targeting mode for distributing the number of blasts among targets, based on their HP\n- Trades all metakinesis for increasing the number of blasts\n- Archetype exclusive feat [Kinetic Railgun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/onslaught-blaster#Kinetic_Railgun) that further adds 1 blast and reduces burn cost when hasted\n- In base game, can fire at most 34 blasts in a single cast with greater kinetic diadem and lesser kineticist rod equipped\n\n# Known issues\n**If you encounter any bug, feel free to fire an issue!** English and Chinese are fine.\n\nTaking levels first in an esoteric blade then a proper kineticist would give you associated composite blasts right away. Not a big deal so not going to fix.\n\nUsing dragoon dive to initiate a battle would sometimes cause you to lose your attacks - that's because the enemy was moving too fast and by the end of the fixed-point jump it's out of reach. This can be partially mitigated by increasing the speed of the character, so jumping time is reduced. It would be too complicated to factor in moving targets in real time, so this is not going to be fixed.\n\nThe reach granted by kinetic spear also applies to natural attacks.\n\nOnslaught blaster's targeted strike sometimes counts fewer blasts than actually fired.\n\nLevelling up during the casting animation of an onslaught blast may cause you to lose one dice permenantly. **Wait for some time until you see your equipments unlock, then level up!**\n\n# Planned contents\nCurrently no guaranteed future contents. Below is a list of archetypes I'm interested in and might try to implement, but given how bizzarre they are I cannot promise anything. Maybe also some more base game fixes around blade whirlwind.\n\n### [Elemental Annihilator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/elemental-annihilator-kineticist-archetype/)\nFeatures Devastating Infusion that can full-attack foes at 120 feet, but only deals a fixed 1d8+ConModifier dmg. Trades all wild talents for extra combat feats. Has a very powerful capstone at 20th level that's a composite infusion at 4 burn dealing 5*(10d6+10) bludgeoning+cold+electricity+fire+force dmg. I suppose it can also be used together with form infusions.\n\n### [Dread Soul](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/dread-soul/)\nEvil only. Forces others to take burn. Drains creatures souls to create soulstones.\n\n### [Nihilicist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/nihilicist/)\nNull element - empty blast and zero blast, dealing direct non-lethal damage. Can convert into lethal damage with a standard action, plus some conditions to the target.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n- [WittleWolfie](https://github.com/WittleWolfie) for [BPCore](https://wittlewolfie.github.io/WW-Blueprint-Core/articles/intro.html) and [Vek17](https://github.com/Vek17) for [TTT-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core).

    "Description": "﻿# Kineticist Elements Expanded\n\nMod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous\n\n\n## Credits and Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to [Truinto][1] author of [Dark Codex][2] for providing help, advice, and some methods so I could gain my own footing in C# and modding P:WoTR\n\nThanks to the entire OwlCat community discord and the modding community there, for answering my plethora of strange questions and pushing me in the right directions\n\nThank you to [Adsam112][3] for some custom icon images for the Void Element\nThank you to [RevanStarForge][4] for some color variations of those images. And for creating a whole bunch of new images for Void, Wood, and Aether!\nThank you Kerrovitarr (Discord) and [q892398745][5] for creating localizations in Russian and Chinese\n\n## Description\n\nThis mod adds expanded element choices for the Kineticist class. Currently this mod adds only the \"Aether\" element from the Tabletop version of Pathfinder.\nMore elements may be coming in the future.\n\nAdded elements means: More blast types, More infusions, wild talents, Elemental Defense, etc.\n\nThis mod originally started as a personal project to add my favorite element, Aether, to the game. But I have expanded the scope to encompass any other elements others might want to add to the game.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for elements to add to the game, please reach out to me, write an issue for the repo, etc.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nI also do not have the skills currently to add custom effects to the game, so any element added will borrow the effect from other kineticist elements.\nI shall try to match the theme/element of the ability as best as possible to make it visually appealing\n\n## Help Requested\n\nThere are a lot of spell effects in game, and I've added a lot of spells, spell-likes, and special abilities that I cannot add all of the required FX or icons myself\n\nIf you come across any icons or FX (projectiles/AoE/etc) that you think might fit one of these abilities, please let me know and I'll get them added soon\nThank you!!\n\n## Content\n\n| Element | Feature | Description | Status |\n| :------ | :------ | :---------: | ------ |\n| Aether | Element Choice | The main aether element, adds selections for base kineticist (and archetypes) and kinetic knight | Done |\n| Aether | Basic Blast and Composite | Telekinetic and Force Blast -

The blast costs should now be correct\n- Kinetic Blade weapon damage display should now work exactly how the base game does it - Still means it's broken. But at least it's accurate\n- Disintegrating infusion now works for Force Blade - If you really, really wanna go for that.

(Greater Toxic/One of the Admixtures)\n\n\n- Now updated for the most recent game version (Thing should just work again<sup>tm</sup>)\n\n### v2.5.2\n\n- Fix Negative Energy Kinetic Blade Text\n- Fix Void Healer prereq for Vampiric Infusion\n- Change icon reference for Positive Admixture to an icon that actually exists\n- Fix Summer/Winter blades correctly targeting normal AC\n- Actually compiled in release mode this time!\n\n### v2.6.0\n\n- Fix a mistake where Aether kineticists were being given the class skills of a Chaokineticist (Void)\n- Fix an issue where everyone was getting Aether Class skills, except it was actually void class skills\n- Buffed Wood Soldiers (They're supposed to have the \"Advanced Template\")\n- Noticed an issue with Skilled Kineticist and Kinetic Knights\n\n[1]: https://github.com/Truinto\n[2]: https://github.com/Truinto/DarkCodex\n[3]: https://github.com/Adsam112\n[4]: https://github.com/RevanStarforge\n[5]: https://github.com/q892398745\n[6]: https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2tk0l?How-much-burn-does-an-Gravitic-Boost\n",

This is only for old books, those that you haven't encountered yet will look normally\n\nDoesn't seem to introduce save dependency.\n\nInstallation: as any other UMM mod",

This is because they don't have an animation for that attack, but the attack will still happen.\n* FIXED: Sometimes even if your Eidolon has arms the game will lock the equipment slots, reloading your game fixes this issue.\n* Bonded Senses doesn't refresh when the eidolon changes their perception ranks, reloading your game fixes this issue.\n* Some eidolons are either too big or don't show at all in the inventory screen.\n```\n## Special Thanks\nThanks to @Vek17#1898, @bubbles#0538, @WittleWolfie#8477, and everyone else on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/owlcat).

    "Description": "# MaxSquadsAdjustment\nSets max squad size to 14 and reworks Master of Maneuver\n\nUnforunately the setting in toybox only increases the max squad size to 14 for armies, but it doesn't increase the max squads that can be fielded in tactical combats. This mod increases the latter to 14, and adjusts base size and MoM to reach 14 on the world map.\n\nStarting squad number for armies is 4 instead of default 3.\n\nMaster of Maneuver is changed from 1 bonus squad to 3 for the first 3 tiers.\nMoM 1 : 1 -> 3\nMoM 2 : 1 -> 3\nMoM 3 : 1 -> 3\nMoM 4 : 1 :( 1\n\nThought about changing it to be something like 1, 2, 3, then 4 so that there'd be a progression as you get the higher ranks, but really after the first 1 or 2 you don't have enough units to easily fill out the last couple slots and MoM 4 is somewhat rare as it comes from either an Act 5 event or the fallout quest. So instead you get to 13 squad size with leveling a general, and the 14th is a little more involved.\n\nAlso, running lots of units without knowing about things like the aggro system or the risk of getting hit by an AoE really just means that the extra squad size can be a trap anyways, and I amuse myself at the thought of someone running into a Balor for the first time and getting half their army nuked by firestorm.\n",

    "Description": "# Microscopic Content Expansion mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous \n## Requirements: [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).\n\nAdd Antipaladin class, some feats, spells and ki powers.\n\n## Featuring\n\n### New classes: \n\n[Antipaladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin)   \nArchetypes available:  \n- [Iron Tyrant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/iron-tyrant-antipaladin-archetype/)\n- [Knight of the Sepulcher](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/knight-of-the-sepulcher)\n- [Tyrant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/tyrant-antipaladin-archetype/)\n\nIMPORTANT: For best experience also install TabletopTweaks-Base. Fiendish template for antipaladin animal companion and Armor Mastery/Shield Mastery feats that can be picked as Iron Tyrant bonus feats are used from TTT. If you don't have TTT-Base, mod will still work, just you will be missing additional possible selections. (No, I won't copypaste those in my mod, don't ask)\n\nNotable differences from PnP:     \nInstead of Aura of Vengeance (lvl 11 ability) which allows Antipaladin to share Smite Good, in mod version 1.16.0 this was replaced with Tip of the Spear (previously capstone option) that allows Smite Good to affect everything. The part that adds 3 bonus smites was removed from it.   \nThis is to make Smite Good useful while not stepping on Paladin's support role. Evil helps themselves, not others.\n\nMark of Vengeance that was previously granted is still in mod files (and will continue to be there for save compatibility), so if you liked how it was previously, you can add it manually with Toybox.\n\n#### Antipaladin exclusive companion and mount - Nightmare (flaming horse)\n\nSize: Large    \nSpeed: 50 ft.    \nAC: +8 natural armor    \nAttack: bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6)    \nAbility scores: Str 18, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 12     \nSpecial qualities: Hoof attacks deal additional 1d4 fire damage.    \nNightmares are not animals, but evil outsiders and thus are not affected by abilities targeting specifically animals or not working on outsiders. That means Animal Growth and Legendary Proporions do NOT work on them. \n\nThey do not have any special level where they get upgrade. They receive the usual bonuses from animal level ups.\n\nCan be mounted with character properly (mostly) sitting on the mount. Occasionally it will be wonky, accept it as what it is.\n\nBardings can be equipped (provided you have proficiency), but they will not show on the model.\n\nThey use Horse portrait.\n\n### New feats\n\n- [Unsanctioned Knowledge (paladin and antipaladin versions)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/unsanctioned-knowledge/)\n- Snake style feat chain\n\t- [Snake Style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-style-combat-style)\n\t- [Snake Sidewind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-sidewind-combat)\n\t- [Snake Fang](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-fang-combat)\n- Startoss style feat chain\n\t- [Startoss Style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-style-combat-style)\n\t- [Startoss Comet](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-comet-combat)\n\t- [Startoss Shower](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-shower-combat)\n- Dimensional Savant feat chain\n    - [Dimensional Agility](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-agility)\n\t- [Dimensional Assault](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-assault)\n\t- [Dimensional Dervish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-dervish)\n- [Flickering Step](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/flickering-step-conduit)\n- [Crusader's Flurry](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/crusader-s-flurry)\n- [Feinting Flurry](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/feinting-flurry-combat) (homebrew change: Zen Archer can apply it with a bow)\n### New spells\n\n- [Deadly Juggernaut (Cleric 3, Inquisitor 3, Paladin 3, Antipaladin 3, Warpriest 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deadly-juggernaut/)   \n- [Blade of Dark Triumph (Antipaladin 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blade-of-dark-triumph)\n- [Blade of Bright Victory (Paladin 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blade-of-bright-victory)\n- [Widen Auras (Antipaladin 2)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/widen-auras/) - note, only Antipaladin, no Paladin version.\n\n### New Ki powers\n- [Ki Power: Deadly Juggernaut](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/qinggong-monk/#8th-Level_Ki_Powers)\n\tNot available for Drunken Master. Can be used by Sensei but can't be shared.\n- [Ki Power: Ki Leech](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/qinggong-monk/#10th-Level_Ki_Powers)\n\tNot available for Drunken Master. Can be used by Sensei but can't be shared.\n- [Ki Power: Diamond Resilience](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/MONK-unchained/#TOC-Ki-Power-Su-)\n\tMade into passive ability (like Diamond Soul) and set to require Monk class level 14. Not available for Drunken Master.\n\n### New class features\n- [Druidic Herbalism](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-classes/druid/#Nature_Bond_Ex)\nFor simplicity of implementation and usage nerfed compared to tabletop description:   \n  Instead of free WIS mod concoctions every day, druid gets to brew any potion for free.\n- [Legion's Blessing (Cleric Crusader archetype lvl 8 feature)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/archetypes/paizo-cleric-archetypes/crusader)\nAllows you to sacrifice spell slot (through spontaneous conversion), making your next spell of exactly 3 levels lower with a range of touch to be applied to all allies in a 10 ft radius.\n\t- properly takes into account metamagic and stuff\n\t- effects that trigger \"on spell cast\" will trigger for each target, which may be desired or not.\n\t- will work on modded spells or spells added through Loremaster. Condition for triggering mass cast simply (range is touch, target is ally).\n\t- you're your own ally. Mass cast will be applied on you/triggered by casting on yourself\n\t- sacrifice spell and subsequent mass-cast are only for Crusader spellbook\n\t- unfortunately this mass cast can't be set up through Bubble Buffs\n\t- Zippy Magic with duplicate original cast once, but won't trigger any more mass casts\n- [Flying Kick (Monk Style Strike)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/Monk-unchained/#TOC-Style-Strike-Ex-)\nGrants pseudo pounce ability Flying Kick, that can be used to move up to Fast Movement amount of feet (so 10 feet at lvl 5, 60 feet at lvl 18+) and at the end attack with flurry of blows\n\t- requires you to have Flurry of Blows active\n\t- requires you to be unarmed\n\t- To qualify for choosing this style you need to have FoB and Fast Movement, so archetypes that trade it away (Sensei and Sohei) can't take it.\n\t- visually you jump and hit with your kick (single attack), then performs full attack without first attack, resulting in total in your normal amount of attacks\n\t- is NOT a charge. Bonuses to charge do not apply\n\t- range grows with Monk level, from 10 feet to 60 feet\n\t- Style grants you toggleable ability, that on toggling will give you ability that actually performs jumpkick. Done this way so that you can't have another style enabled until you are allowed to have two active styles\n- [Timeless Body (Monk level 17 feature)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/MONK-unchained/#TOC-Timeless-Body-Ex-)\n\tImplemented as immunity to couple of very specific effects.\n- [Flawless Mind (Monk level 19 feature)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/MONK-unchained/#TOC-Flawless-Mind)\n\tWhenever a monk attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result.\n\n### Homebrew changes (all default to OFF)\n\nChanges that make sense to me, enable if you like (and don't forget to restart the game!)\n\n#### Dragonblood Shifter\n- Make Draconic Aspect (minor aspect) last indefinitely.\n- At levels 9, 14 and 20 allow 2, 3, 4 aspects enabled at the same time.\n- Add at lvl 4 bite attack with 1.5 STR bonus.\n- Add at lvl 5 draconic wings that are active during dragon aspect and match in color last activated aspect- \n- Add Airborne property to dragon forms given by class.\n- Increase STR/CON bonuses provided by dragon forms given by class by 0/2/4.\n- Make class dragon form bite attack use 1.5 STR bonus.\n- Make Thousand Bites spell affect dragon forms of lvl 20 Dragonblood Shifter.\n- Allow applying metamagic to mythic GD spells where metamagic tags were not present.\n- Add Ravener form for lvl 20 Dragonblood shifters that are Undead (so normally Liches after ritual). Adds to CHA instead of CON.\n\nReasoning:    \nDraconic aspect bonuses are so small that having them on a timer is just bad. Multiple aspects mirror chimeric aspect. On lvl 20 this will result in you being immune to 4 elements, but a) that's pure no dips lvl 20, b) casters could do it earlier anyway.\nBite at lvl 4 because that's where normal shifters spike in power with their major form.\nWings because why not. Feyform and Griffonheart give wings at 5.\n\nAirborne (that full dragons have, but normal polymorphs don't) gives immunity to all ground things and trip. \n0/2/4 bonus is just so you don't feel bad that BFT could share same dragon form but with higher stats bonuses.    \n1.5x STR bonus on bite because most dragons have that.\nLet's have archetype that is all about dragons forms that at mildly superior to what others can have.\n\n#### Zen Archer\n- allow Feinting Flurry to work with Zen Archer flurry after lvl 7 (provided ZA has feint and ranged feint feats)\n- add feint feats to lvl 6+ bonus feats\n- add Snap Shot Improved and Greater to lvl 10+ bonus feats\n- add Cunning Archer at lvl 4 - acts as Combat Expertise for prerequisites and allows to use Wisdom instead of Intelligence for prerequisites\n\nReasoning:  \nZen Archer needed help. It was losing in archery to Sohei even without accounting for a pet.   \nWith those changes he has a niche of ranged feinter that can do feint while still full-attacking.\n\n#### Mythic Armor Feats\n- Use armor enhancement bonus for DR penetration in Heavy and Medium mythic offense feats. I.e. bonus damage from +5 heavy armor counts as if it came from +5 weapon.\n\nReasoning:    \nDescription says that you strike with your armor spikes, and if my armor is magical, surely strike from it would be magical?\n\n#### Mythic Feats  \n- replace effect of Dodge (Mythic) with the following:\n\n\tWhen focused, you become nearly impossible to strike.   \nBenefit: Whenever you are targeted by an effect that requires an attack roll, including weapon attacks, if attacker rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll, they must reroll the die once.\n\nReasoning: it desperately needed a buff. If your tanks is getting hit only on 20, this is equivalent to Protective Luck. You could say it helps the most those who need it the least, but at least it helps good tanks.\n\n## Thanks to  \n-   bubbles and Vek17 specifically   \n-   kadyn for his Expanded Content\n-   Fumihiko for making of Snake Style for Kingmaker\n-   Jarly for Russian localization\n-   Pathfinder Wrath of The Righteous Discord channel members\n-   PS: Wolfie's [Modding Wiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki) is an excellent place to start if you want to start modding on your own.\n-   Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr)",

    "Description": "# Miscellaneous Tweaks and Fixes for WotR\n\nA small collection of fixes or tweaks to things that bugged me while playing.\nRequires [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases)\n\nAll features can be enabled or disabled in the Mods menu.\n\n### Natural Attack Stacking\n\nPreviously, if you got multiple natural attacks of the same type from different features/buffs/etc.\nyou would get extra attacks per round. This was 'fixed' by Owlcat at some point so now extra natural \nattacks give no benefit to PCs. With this enabled, vanilla behaviour is replaced with an approximation\nof the tabletop rules:\n\nAddtional natural attacks of the same kind gives a stacking increase to the effective size of the 'weapon'\n(eg. 2 pairs of Medium claw attacks effectively grant 1 pair of Large claw attacks instead).\n\nYou get all 'enchantment' effects (elemental damage/DR penetration/etc.) but multiple enchants of the same type\ndo not stack.\n\n### Major Strength Blessing Armor Speed Fix\n\nWarpriest's Major Blessing for Strength domain now applies to heavy armor in addition to medium\narmor - now matches its description.\n\n### Force Book of Dreams Upgrade\n\nThe Book of Dreams item is supposed to upgrade at certain points in the story,\nbut this has never reliably worked (at least in my experience). Enabling this forces the \nupgrade script to run on every Etude update. Disabled by default.\n\n### Identify natural weapons\n\nIn some cases, \"enchanted\" natural weapons will appear as Unidentified, requiring a Knowledge (Arcana) check\nto identify. This force identifies natural weapons on equip\n\n(This was already included in previous versions of the mod and enabled at all times,\nbut has now been given its own setting)\n\n### Fix empty hand weapon equip\n\nWhen multiple features or buffs grant \"empty hand replacement\" weapons (eg. claws) the game is supposed to equip the \"best\" set\nbut sometimes it just chooses the newest (which may be worse than the claws they're replacing).\nThis adds an additional check after equip to try to ensure the \"best\" weapon was selected.\n\n### Reformed Fiend DR/good\n\nChanges the damage reduction for the Reformed Fiend Bloodrage archetype from DR/evil to DR/good.\nDisabled by default.\n\n### Dollroom postprocessing filter toggles\n\nAllows you to disable some postprocess filters in the dollroom (inventory screen, character creation. mythic level up, etc.)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Special thanks to the modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) - in particular, Pheonix99 and Bubbles.\n* WittleWolfie for ModMenu\n",

    "Description": "# ModMenu\n\nAdds a new page to the game options for mods. This allows mods to easily implement settings using native UI instead of UMM. This does not create a save dependency.\n\nEach mod has its own dedicated settings page. Select which mod's settings page to view from the drop-down menu:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Base_Mod_Selection_Menu.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Mod selection drop-down screenshot\" style=\"width: 45vw\"/></p>\n\nSome sample settings configurations:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Test_Settings_1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Test settings screenshot\" style=\"width: 45vw\"/></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Test_Settings_2.png?raw=true\" alt=\"More settings screenshot\" style=\"width: 45vw\"/></p>\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.27.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for ModMenu\n3. Click \"Install\"\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/releases/latest) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/issues/new) or reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) in #mod-dev-technical or #mod-user-general channel.\n\n### Controller Support\n\n**This does not support controllers**.\n\n## Mods Using ModMenu\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list, let me know if you want your mod added here!\n\n* [BOAT BOAT BOAT](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_BOAT_BOAT_BOAT)\n* [Character Options+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus)\n  \n## Mod Developers\n\n### Why should you use it?\n\n* It looks nice!\n* Automatically persists your settings\n* Handles restoring defaults\n* Automatically persists per-save settings\n* Super easy to use\n\n### How to use it\n\nThe test screenshots above were generated using [TestSettings](ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs). That exercises every function supported. The API is documented and generally self-explanatory.\n\nIn your mod's `Info.json` add `ModMenu` as a requirement:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu\"]\n```\n\nYou should specify a minimum version:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu-1.1.0\"]\n```\n\nIt's safest to just specify the version you build against as the minimum version, but methods added after 1.0 do specify the version in their remarks.\n\nInstall ModMenu then in your mod's project add `%WrathPath%/Mods/ModMenu/ModMenu.dll` as an assembly reference.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nCreate a setting:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.AddSettings(\n  SettingsBuilder.New(\"mymod-settings, SettingsTitle)\n    .AddToggle(Toggle.New(\"mymod-settings-toggle\", defaultValue: true, MyToggleTitle)\n      .OnValueChanged(OnToggle)));\n      \nprivate static void OnToggle(bool toggleValue) {\n  // The user just changed the toggle, toggleValue is the new setting.\n  // If you need to react to it changing then you can do that here.\n  // If you don't need to do something whenever the value changes, you can skip OnValueChanged()\n}\n```\n\nGet the setting value:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.GetSettingValue<bool>(\"mymod-settings-toggle\");\n```\n\n**The game handles the setting value for you.** You do not need to save the setting, or set the setting to a specific value. You *can* set it if necessary but most of the time it isn't necessary. This includes saving settings that you flag as per-save using `DependsOnSave()`.\n\nFor more examples see [TestSettings](ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs).\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* **Do not add settings during mod load,** without additional handling you cannot create a `LocalizedString`. I recommend adding settings before, during, or after `BlueprintsCache.Init()`.\n* Don't use `IsModificationAllowed` to enable/disable a setting based on another setting. This is checked when the page is opened so it won't apply immediately.\n* Indicate settings which require reboot using `WithLongDescription()`. The game's setting boolean `RequireReboot` does nothing.\n\nDefine a \"root\" key unique to your mod to make sure there are no key conflicts:\n\n```C#\nprivate const string RootKey = \"mymod-settings\";\n```\n\nYou can then prepend this to all of your settings keys:\n\n```C#\n\n// Results in a settings key \"mymod-settings-key\"\nvar toggle = Toggle.New(GetKey(\"toggle\"), MyToggleTitle);\n\nprivate static string GetKey(string key)\n{\n  return $\"{RootKey}-{key}\";\n}\n```\n\nJust make sure you always get the key the same way when getting a setting value.\n\n### Settings Behavior\n\n* Settings with `DependsOnSave()` are associated with a save slot, but do not create save dependencies\n    * You do not need to handle saving or restoring settings at all, though save dependent settings may be lost if the mod is disabled\n* `OnValueChanged()` is called after the user clicks \"Apply\" and confirms\n* `OnTempValueChanged()` is called immediately after the user changes the value, but before it is applied\n* A setting's value can be checked at any time by calling [GetSettingValue()](ModMenu/ModMenu.cs#L85)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Kuru, for his hard work on the new fork\n* A shout out to Bubbles (factsubio) who essentially wrote the new image and button settings types when I was about to give up.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

    "Description": "# Mythic Magic Mayhem v1.1.0 for WoTR\n## Requirements: [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu). [Spellbook Merge](https://github.com/vikigenius/SpellbookMerge/tree/master).\n- Make all mythic spell books mergeable with any spell book!\n- 4th and 6th casters gain extra spell slots:\n![extraspellslots](https://github.com/YLMstring/Mythic-Magic-Mayhem/assets/61271096/c06aeaf6-1418-480a-8ca2-efb23944d3de)\n- The mod overrides Spellbook Merge Mod, making all of its options unavailable lol\n- All features are toggleable, and more toggleable than Prestige Plus\n### Lich adjustments:\n- Add lesser animate dead to lich spellbook\n- Improve Undead Mount power by adding a CHA bonus to mount equal to mythic rank\n- Add a mythic power option to turn a companion's animal companion into undead template\n- Add a passive perk at MR5 to use CON or CHA (whichever is highest) for fort and hp modifiers\n### Angel adjustments:\n- Increase Bolt of Justice to 7th level\n- Increase Storm of Justice to 9th level\n- Wrath of the Righteous is now 8th level and affects evil demons only (Arue <3)\n- Add Improved Angelic Halo - Divine Champion: While Angelic Halo is active energy damage is converted into holy damage\n- Add Improved Angelic Halo - Flames of Heaven: While Angelic Halo is active energy damage is converted into fire damage\n### Azata adjustments:\n- Azata is now a full caster!\n![azataspell](https://github.com/YLMstring/Mythic-Magic-Mayhem/assets/61271096/7c67d046-161f-4319-93cd-0b999c01d1e2)\n- New Superpower - Harmonious Echo: Azata may start a second performance while maintaining another.\n- New Spell - Group Hug: This spell functions as friendly hug, except that it affects all allies in the area.\n- New Spell - Elysium Choir: When you sing all of Elysium joins with you. You use every performance ability you know. Those with a duration last for the duration of the spell (1 min), these benefits do not use up your daily usage of performance abilities.\n- New Spell - Primordial Dragon Dance: The primordial power of Elysium flows through you blasting your enemies and rendering them vulnerable to your elemental power.  Choose an element (fire, cold, lightning, acid or sonic) when you cast the spell, the spell leaps from target to target in the same way as chain lightning inflicting 1d6 damage of the chosen element per caster level. The target also gains vulnerability to the selected element for 1 minute, succeeding in a saving throw halves the damage but does not prevent the vulnerability effect.\n### Aeon adjustments:\n- Aeon is now a full caster!\n![aeonspell](https://github.com/YLMstring/Mythic-Magic-Mayhem/assets/61271096/82323a86-62e9-4dad-ac7a-80aabc7c8037)\n- New Spell - Edict of Total Nullification: The aeon and his agents are protected from all harm by the will of the cosmos. The Aeon and all allies within a 20 foot radius gain the benefits of the Protection From Energy, Communal spell with the exception that it applies to any and all damage types, absorbs 10 per caster level and has separate damage pools. The damage types affected are physical, fire, cold, acid, lightning, sonic, positive, negative, holy, unholy and divine.\n- New Spell - Edict of Absolute Authority: The natural order of the universe is absolute, and thus so is your authority. As a swift action you cause all enemies within a 30 foot radius to suffer the effects of the Edict of Retaliation and Edict of Nonresistance spells (saving separately for each).\n- New Spell - Temporal Interdiction: The heart of the Aeon's power is their mastery over space and time.  The most awesome of these powers is the ability to literally freeze time for a short period for all but themselves. For 1 round the Aeon gains the ability to cast up to three spells as a free action.\n### Demon adjustments:\n- Demon is now a full caster!\n![demonspell](https://github.com/YLMstring/Mythic-Magic-Mayhem/assets/61271096/ecf202f1-cb7b-4d3f-98c1-2b4cea607a0a)\n- New Spell - Blind Fury: Targets in the area must pass a willpower saving throw or suffer the effects of the rage spell and the blindness condition.  In addition those who fail their saving throw lose the benefits of true seeing, blind fighting or any other effect that allows them to ignore or reroll the miss chance caused by concealment.\n- New Spell - Abyssal Breach: Tearing a hole through Golarion's dimensional fabric you create a gateway for some of the most powerful denizens of the abyss to come to your aid.  Each round a random demon appears and will fight on your side for 1 minute.  The demon summoned each round is random with a CR between 13 and 25.\n- New Spell - Demonic Form V: Your mastery over demonic forms has reached an unparalleled level. Harnessing the power of the abyss you can transform into a Primeval Retriever, an ancient and unique hunter of the abyss that preyed upon even the most powerful of demons that trespassed into it's territory. This creature inspired such fear in all demon kind that it inspired the demon lords to fashion their retriever constructs in its image. The Primeval Retriever can cast disintegration as a swift action at will using your caster level for damage, a vicious bite that grapples it's prey and chitinous legs harder than adamantine.\n### Trickster adjustments:\n- Trickster is now a full caster!\n![tricksterspell](https://github.com/YLMstring/Mythic-Magic-Mayhem/assets/61271096/53f098a0-d62b-481e-8916-05e001390cea)\n- New Spell - Hall of Mirrors: The best tricks are all down to smoke and mirrors, you have leveraged this fact to trick the enemy's senses into believing there are far more of you and your companions than is otherwise possible.  For the duration of the spell you and all allies within 30 feet of you are affected by the mirror image spell with the exception that the images refresh every round. \n- New Spell - Rain of Halberdiers: Conjuring halberds to rain from the sky is all well and good, but what's the point of having all these halberds without someone to wield them?  This spell functions as Rain of Halberds with the exception that it summons one grave knight (as per the create undead spell) per four caster levels for the duration of the spell.\n- New Spell - Trick Developer: You came to the realisation long ago that life is just a game, and if so then that means someone had to have designed that game.  There is no one you cannot trick and you use this to tap into potential you otherwise wouldn't (and shouldn't) have.  Choose one of the following 10th level mythic spells (Army of Heaven, Absolute Death, Abyssal Breach, Edict of Absolute Authority or Elysium Choir), you cast that spell.\n- New Spell - ‘Helpful’ Metagamer: Every group of friends has someone who ‘knows better’ and has no problem with sharing their superior knowledge with their companions regardless of whether or not it has been asked for, congratulations for being THAT guy. For 1 minute while within a 30ft radius of the trickster all allies gain Sneaky Quack, ignore critical hit and precision damage immunity and gain sneak attack dice equal to the trickster's if it's not already higher. When the spell ends all allies become exhausted for 1 minute due to the constant frustrating ’suggestions‘ from the trickster.\n## Thanks to  \n-   WittleWolfie for his [Blueprint-Core](https://wittlewolfie.github.io/WW-Blueprint-Core/index.html), which makes modding easy and enjoyable.\n-   Bubbles (factsubio) for BubblePrints, saving me from going mad.\n-   vikigenius for Spellbook Merge!   \n-   All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n-   Pathfinder Wrath of The Righteous Discord channel members.\n-   Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr)\n",

    "Description": "# Mythic Path Power Swapper mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nAllows changing mythic powers to powers from another path, or playing without mythic powers at all.\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download:  \n\nFirst get [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) if you don't have it\n\nNow download this mod: [**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/MythicPathPowerSwapper/releases/latest)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Install ModMenu.\n3. Install this mod.\n4. Set settings to your liking.\n5. Restart to apply them.\n   \n## Functionality\n\nSafe to remove mid-game unless you're using Legendarify. If you're using Legendarify see Uninstallation instructions below.\n\nAffects ALL saves globally.\n\n**SETTING CHANGES APPLY ONLY AFTER RESTART**\n\nHow to use: \nChoose which mythic path to change.\nChoose how to change.\n\n\nLegendarify option remove mythic powers and spellbook, grants rising bonus to all stats and modifies XP table so you get levels earlier. See section later.\n\nOption \"remove path powers\" makes your progression like your companions. \"Remove all powers\" removes everything. You still has mythic rank, but no abilities.\n\nSo for example if you pick Demon in first selection and Lich in second, your Demon will have Lich powers and Lich spellbook.\n\nNote on \"Add Aivu\":  \nThis adds Aivu to the selected mythic path (regardless of what you're copying from). I don't know what that will do. You wil have her, but will she talk, get recognized, break quests or your whole game - no clue. It's just a setting that took me 20 minutes to add, so I did because I can. If you try it, feel free to tell me how things went for you.\n\nOptions to demythic mythic hero and companions can be enabled without changes to your path powers.\n\n## Notes\n- Affects ALL ongoing games. If you set for example Lich have Aeon powers, that changes some Aeon powers to rely on Lich Mythic class, meaning some Aeon powers will not work correctly when you're an Aeon until you reset the power swap or remove the mod.\n- Affects things that are defined in mythic class progression. If you see it on mythic page - it's will be affected.   \n- You will get spellbook from the class that you copy from.    \n- You will receive Artifact Cloak of your original path, but enchantment will be swapped to the copied path.   \n- Story will proceed as your original path, there will be no recognition of \"wrong\" powers.    \n- If you're on Azata path you get Aivu as normal, because she's important to the story.   \n- If you copy from Azata, you by default do not gain Aivu, unless you toggle \"Add Aivu\" to On.\n\n- Azata receives spells depending on sub-path. So if you copy from Azata you don't get them. My advice - use TTT-Reworks, it adds those spells anyway.\n\n- Late game paths are unchanged. If you swap to Devil with changed progression I have no idea what will happen. Probably nothing, but it's on you.\nChanging to other late game paths that remove your old path abilities should work as usual.\n\n## Legendarify\n- Changes base mythic path to gradually give more levels with a a cap of 40 instead of getting usual mythic bonuses\n- Is not a Legend path plot wise and will not trigger Legend interactions in A5\n- Removes mythic powers from M3+, leaving you with M1 and M2 powers only\n- On ranks 3-5-7-9 you get stacking +1 bonus to all stats (total +4 to all stats at MR9)\n- With each mythic rank XP table gets shorter and shorter. At M3-M4 you can expect to be 1-2 levels higher than normal, at M5-M6 3-5 levels higher. At M9 progression is almost like normal legend, but to get to level 40 you need more experience than normal Legend. But you still will get lvl 40 eventually, just somewhat later. For comparison normal legend lvl 40 = legendarified lvl 38.\n- If you swap to late game non-Legend path, you get to keep your levels over 20. As far as I'm concerned this is your responsibility.\n- Exact XP table is at the bottom of readme.\n- You also get hidden legend feature that removes path visual changes.\n- *Legendarify causes removable save dependency* - don't remove mod without following uninstallation instructions\n\n## Uninstallation\n1. Reset mod options to change nothing to nothing.\n2. Respec your character.\n3. Remove mod.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nUnless you enabled \"Add Aivu\", turning mod off and doing respec will solve all your problems.\nIf you used \"Add Aivu\" maybe respec will help. Maybe not.\n\n## Compatibility with mods\nMaybe?   \nDepends on what and how they do things. \nIs mostly compatible with TTT at least, that I checked.\nI've tried to set priorities so it loads also after Path of Rage and Spellbook Merge and MythicMagicMayhem, so their changes should be forwarded.\n\n## Can I have multiple paths?  \nOut of scope for this mod.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### XP Tables\n\nNormal is normal XP table   \nLegend is Legend XP table   \nM3 - M9 is how your table changes over the course of mythic ranks.  \n\n| Level | Normal | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | Legend |   \n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |   \n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n| 2 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000\n| 3 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000\n| 4 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000\n| 5 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000\n| 6 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000\n| 7 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000\n| 8 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000\n| 9 | 75000 | 69000 | 67000 | 66000 | 64000 | 62000 | 61000 | 59000 | 55000\n| 10 | 105000 | 94000 | 89000 | 85000 | 80000 | 77000 | 73000 | 69000 | 62000\n| 11 | 155000 | 125000 | 120000 | 110000 | 100000 | 94000 | 87000 | 81000 | 68000\n| 12 | 220000 | 170000 | 155000 | 140000 | 125000 | 115000 | 105000 | 94000 | 75000\n| 13 | 315000 | 235000 | 205000 | 180000 | 160000 | 140000 | 125000 | 110000 | 85000\n| 14 | 445000 | 315000 | 270000 | 235000 | 200000 | 170000 | 150000 | 125000 | 96000\n| 15 | 635000 | 430000 | 360000 | 300000 | 250000 | 210000 | 175000 | 150000 | 105000\n| 16 | 890000 | 580000 | 475000 | 385000 | 315000 | 260000 | 210000 | 170000 | 115000\n| 17 | 1300000 | 785000 | 625000 | 500000 | 395000 | 315000 | 250000 | 200000 | 130000\n| 18 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 830000 | 645000 | 500000 | 390000 | 300000 | 235000 | 155000\n| 19 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 1100000 | 830000 | 625000 | 475000 | 360000 | 270000 | 180000\n| 20 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1450000 | 1050000 | 790000 | 580000 | 430000 | 315000 | 200000\n| 21 |  | 2650000 | 1900000 | 1400000 | 990000 | 710000 | 515000 | 370000 | 220000\n| 22 |  | 3600000 | 2550000 | 1750000 | 1250000 | 875000 | 610000 | 430000 | 260000\n| 23 |  | 4900000 | 3350000 | 2300000 | 1550000 | 1050000 | 730000 | 500000 | 280000\n| 24 |  | 6600000 | 4400000 | 2950000 | 1950000 | 1300000 | 875000 | 580000 | 315000\n| 25 |  | 8950000 | 5850000 | 3800000 | 2450000 | 1600000 | 1050000 | 680000 | 370000\n| 26 |  | 12000000 | 7700000 | 4900000 | 3100000 | 1950000 | 1250000 | 790000 | 445000\n| 27 |  | 16500000 | 10000000 | 6300000 | 3900000 | 2400000 | 1500000 | 920000 | 500000\n| 28 |  | 22500000 | 13500000 | 8100000 | 4900000 | 2950000 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 635000\n| 29 |  | 30500000 | 18000000 | 10500000 | 6150000 | 3600000 | 2100000 | 1250000 | 720000\n| 30 |  | 41000000 | 23500000 | 13500000 | 7700000 | 4400000 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 890000\n| 31 |  | 55500000 | 31000000 | 17500000 | 9700000 | 5400000 | 3000000 | 1700000 | 1000000\n| 32 |  | 75500000 | 41000000 | 22500000 | 12000000 | 6650000 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1300000\n| 33 |  | 100000000 | 54000000 | 29000000 | 15500000 | 8100000 | 4300000 | 2300000 | 1550000\n| 34 |  | 140000000 | 71500000 | 37000000 | 19000000 | 9950000 | 5150000 | 2650000 | 1800000\n| 35 |  | 190000000 | 94500000 | 48000000 | 24000000 | 12000000 | 6150000 | 3100000 | 2000000\n| 36 |  | 255000000 | 125000000 | 61500000 | 30500000 | 15000000 | 7350000 | 3600000 | 2550000\n| 37 |  | 345000000 | 165000000 | 79500000 | 38000000 | 18500000 | 8750000 | 4200000 | 3000000\n| 38 |  | 465000000 | 220000000 | 100000000 | 48000000 | 22500000 | 10500000 | 4900000 | 3600000\n| 39 |  | 635000000 | 290000000 | 130000000 | 60000000 | 27500000 | 12500000 | 5700000 | 4050000\n| 40 |  | 860000000 | 380000000 | 170000000 | 75500000 | 33500000 | 15000000 | 6650000 | 4700000\n",

    "Description": "# Nine Swords\nA mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous implementing the classes found in the Tome of Battle: Nine Swords supplement (https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/tome-of-battle-the-book-of-nine-swords--88/)\nThere were some changes necessary both to adapt to the Pathfinder ruleset as well as accommodate Wrath of the Righteous\n\n## Contents\n - Warblade class\n - 60+ Maneuvers (including a tiny number of Boosts and 6 Counters) and 10 Stances from the Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw and White Raven disciplines\n\n## Deviations from Rules as Written\n### Spontaneous preparation\nInstead of having to prepare maneuvers ahead of time as a wizard would, all classes will have all known maneuvers available at all times as a sorcerer does, the number of known and available maneuvers was not changed. This is way less work to implement and makes the classes more flexible.\n\n### Recovering Maneuvers\nWarblades recover maneuvers with a move action ability that HAS to hit an enemy and recovers two uses of maneuvers.\nSwordsages recover all their maneuvers by spending a single full round action.\nBoth changes where made to balance maneuver recovery, as written Swordsage recovery was comically bad\n\n### Individual Maneuvers\n - Maneuvers that should give your allies an attack bonus against an individual enemy, instead lowers the targets natural armor\n - Stances that say they end when moving more than 5 feet do not have this limitation\n - Hunter's Sense: gives blindsense analogous to other WOTR abilities that are described as \"Scent\"\n - Steel Wind: doesn't let you choose targets, the game will choose two targets and attack those\n - Flesh Ripper: penalties last for 1 minute instead of being dynamic\n - Bounding Assault: Teleports to target as a swift action\n - Overwhelming Mountain Strike and Irresistible Mountain Strike: staggers target instead of disabling move action\n - Hearing the Air: giving blindsight to distinguish it more from the lvl1 Hunter's Sense\n - Scything Blade: doesn't require having made a successful attack\n - All maneuvers related to charging do not directly cause you to charge a target, instead they give you a buff that modifies your charge. This is rather annoying but I didn't find a way to make it work properly otherwise\n - Lions Roar triggers directly when used, but requires a move action\n \n### Counters\nCounters had to be changed to a simple on/off toggle to compensate for the fact that I can't interrupt events to ask the player if a counter should be used. Additionally:\n\n - Wall of Blades and Manticore Parry triggers on being attacked, costs at most 2 maneuver points per round and tries to parry all attacks for 1 round, each successful parry adds a -1 penalty to subsequent parries in the same round. If maneuver points where spent on Wall of Blades Manticore Parry will be free and vice versa\n - Iron Heart Focus triggers on failing a save and costs at most 2 maneuver points per round and retries all failed saves for 1 round\n - Lightning Recovery triggers on failing an attack roll and retries them at a cost of 1 maneuver point per fail\n - Diamond Defense was changed to a simple toggle and gives a +9 bonus to all saves at a cost of 1 maneuver point per round\n\n### Homebrew\n - Boomerang Throw and Vicious Throw as lower level options for the level 8 Lightning Throw\n - White Raven Call as a replacement for the level 9 White Raven maneuver that cannot be implemented into WOTR; White Raven Call gives massive bonuses to self and allies for 1 round\n - Several feats including Maneuver Focus, Maneuver Focus (Mythic) and a specific feat for each discipline with unique effects\n\n## Roadmap\n - Swordsage class\n - Disciplines available to Swordsage\n - Prestige Classes from the Tome of Battle (probably as Archetypes for the two classes in order to Pathfinderfy them)\n - Classes and Maneuvers from the Path of War (https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/), probably I'll fold the Maneuvers into the disciples from Path of War\n - Homebrew Maneuvers to fill out any remaining gaps in the Maneuver-List because some Maneuvers in the books cannot be implemented or would not be useful in WOTR\n\n# Contributing\nThis is my first mod and I learned a lot while working on it, but I'm sure there is a lot that could be improved.\nIf you have any suggestions for improvements please feel free to open a discussion thread or an issue on github.\n\n# Special Thanks\nto WittleWolfie for the excellent https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core",

Optional (object bond, healing, etc..) can be accessed with right click.\n\nPlanned Features:\n*  Persistence.  Remember meta and header choices.\n*  Mark valid conversions with an indicator.\n\nKnown Issue:\n* Max meta's is 12, do you really need more than 12?\n",

Download and install Unity Mod Manager, make sure it is at least version 0.23.0\n2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n3. Download the WOTR_PATH_OF_RAGE mod\n4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n```\n## Changes\n```\n* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.\n* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.\n* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling.\n* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC.\n* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.\n* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.\n* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.\n* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.\n* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.\n* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.\n* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Lilithu, gaining a bonus to your Charisma as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Oolioddroo, gaining a bonus to your Dexterity and allowing all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* Fixes Demonic Aura so that it will only apply its damage when an enemy starts a new round instead of every time you activate Bloodrage.\n* Fixes autometamagic so that it will work on spells that are not originally part of a spellbook but added later. This is important for Arcane Bloodline for Bloodragers.\n* Adds a new mythic ability called Mighty Demonrage. This allows you to cast a demon spell of fourth level or lower as a swift action while Demon Raging.\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Oolioddroo major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge. This is because it conflicts with Abyssal Bulk from Bloodragers, and it's not tabletop compliant.\n* Added compatibility with TTT-Base and the Brimorak Aspect Fix. If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage. This only affects the new Demon Rage.\n* Demon Rage now updated. You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat. This also means it will not turn off when combat ends, meaning you get to stay angry even between cutscenes!\n* Elemental Rampager is now activated when you start your demonic rage.\n* Balor Aspect should no longer give its intelligence bonus.\n* Fixed bug with demon rage that causes it to persist when given as part of a cutscene.\n```\n## Current New Abilities\n![alt text](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_PATH_OF_RAGE/blob/master/PathOfRageDemonologies.png?raw=true)\n## Change Log\n```\n03/26/2023\n* Allows Demonic Charge to target a point instead of a unit.\n03/15/2023\n* Hotfix for Demon Rend and non-shapeshifted polymorph spells.\n03/14/2023\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage.

You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat. This also means it will not turn off when combat ends, meaning you get to stay angry even between cutscenes!\n* Elemental Rampager is now activated when you start your demonic rage.\n10/11/2022\n* Brimorak Aspect Fix now works with the Areelu cloak.\n* Added compatibility with TTT-Base and the Brimorak Aspect Fix. If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Made the new demon rage no longer work with Dark Codex's infinite rage resource.\n03/21/2022\n* Carnage Incarnate's vulnerability removed\n* Carnage Incarnate's debuff will now deal 1d6 damage whenever attacked with a weapon.\n* Carnage Incarnate's explosion radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n* DEMONIC SMASH's radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n03/11/2022\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Quasit major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge.

This is because Enduring Spells no longer works on abilities.\n* Aspect of Lilithu has been added. This gives you a Charisma bonus as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* Aspect of Quasit has been added. This gives you a Dexterity bonus and allows all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* BlueprintCore has been stripped down to the bare essentials to what this mod needs to hopefully make it easier to survive updates in the future.\n01/09/2022\n* Fixed text on Demon Rage to correctly state that it starts at 12 rounds instead of 18\n* Demon Blast correctly is now given at rank 4 instead of rank 3\n11/25/2021\n* Fixed Demon Rage so that it no longer stays if triggered in a cutscene\n* Updated Unleashed Demon so that you may polymorph into a Sin Guzzler at Rank 9 at will for 24 hours.\n\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\nThanks to @Vek17#1898, @bubbles#0538, @kadyn#6364, @WittleWolfie#8477, and everyone else on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/owlcat).

Does not overwrite or replace any of the vanilla soundsets.\n\nAlso provides a [custom portrait set](https://github.com/DarthParametric/WOTR_Custom_Soundset_Viconia_DeVir/releases/latest/download/Portraits.zip), if required.\n\n# Install\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) and set it up for WOTR (\"Pathfinder Second Adventure\").\n1. Download the latest version of the mod from [Github](https://github.com/DarthParametric/WOTR_Custom_Soundset_Viconia_DeVir/releases/latest) or [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/712). Alternatively, the mod is now also available via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n1. Download the latest version of ModMenu from [Github](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/releases/latest) or via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n1. Install both mods manually, via UMM, or via ModFinder.\n1. Run your game.\n1. There is an optional setting in ModMenu that allows you to adjust the frequency of the movement barks, as these are quite infrequent by default:\n   <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Viconia_Soundset_MM_Options.png?raw=true\" alt=\"ModMenu bark config options screenshot\" width=\"500\" height=\"130\"/></p>\n1. The custom soundset will appear in the character creator Voice list for females after all the vanilla soundsets:\n   <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Viconia_Soundset_Character_Creator_List.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Character creator voice selection screenshot\" width=\"288\" height=\"400\"/></p>\n\n# Notes\n- Certain lines may be overly loud due to the nature of the source audio and the normalisation process. Please report anything obnoxious so it can be manually adjusted.\n- The source audio lacks much in the way of whispering or quiet lines, so there is minimal diversity in the stealth lines, along with some regular lines with the volume reduced.\n- Similarly, there's a lack of diversity or even anything appropriate at all for certain lines. If anyone skilled with AI voice generation is willing to take a crack at creating new custom lines, let me know.\n- Some Grey DeLisle audio from other games has been used to bulk out certain barks (mostly non-verbal attack grunts, pain cries, etc.)\n- If you wish to use the optional custom portraits, copy the folder into `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous\\Portraits` (on Windows).\n\n# Thanks & Acknowledgements\n- Uses the `wrathsoundvoicemod` mod template from [OwlcatNuGetTemplates](https://github.com/xADDBx/OwlcatNuGetTemplates) as a basis.\n- microsoftenator2022 - Provided lots of help with troubleshooting the original Wwise and project setup, leading to the creation of the dedicated `wrathsoundvoicemod` template (as well as extensive work on the original `wrathsoundmod` template).\n- Everyone in the `#mod-dev-technical` channel of the Owlcat Discord server for various modding-related discussions and suggestions, help troubleshooting issues, and answering general questions.\n- Original audio taken from Bioware's Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Star Wars The Old Republic, Beamdog's BG1 Siege of Dragonspear, and Obsidian's Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II.\n",

    "Description": "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Gelt_Soundset_Header.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Header image\"/></p>\n\n# About\n\nA mod for Owlcat's Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.\n\nAdds a custom, standalone soundset for male PCs and mercenaries in Wrath of the Righteous, including custom casting lines that replace the vanilla chanting. Does not overwrite or replace any of the vanilla soundsets.\n\nAlso provides a couple of [custom portrait sets](https://github.com/DarthParametric/WOTR_Custom_Soundset_Balthasar_Gelt/releases/latest/download/Portraits.zip), if required.\n\n# Install\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) and set it up for WOTR (\"Pathfinder Second Adventure\").\n1. Download the latest version of the mod from [Github](https://github.com/DarthParametric/WOTR_Custom_Soundset_Balthasar_Gelt/releases/latest) or [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/713). Alternatively, it is now also available via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n1. Download the latest version of ModMenu from [Github](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/releases/latest) or via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n1. Install both mods manually, via UMM, or via ModFinder.\n1. Run your game.\n1. There is an optional setting in ModMenu that allows you to adjust the frequency of the movement barks, as these are quite infrequent by default:\n   <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Gelt_Soundset_MM_Options.png?raw=true\" alt=\"ModMenu bark config options screenshot\" width=\"500\" height=\"130\"/></p>\n1. The custom soundset will appear in the character creator Voice list for males after all the vanilla soundsets:\n   <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/Gelt_Soundset_Character_Creator_List.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Character creator voice selection screenshot\"/></p>\n\n# Notes\n- Just like vanilla chants, the custom casting chants won't play when a spell's casting animation is disabled. For example, a Quickened spell.\n- While there is provision for both pre-cast and on-cast lines, I have left the pre-casts blank to avoid overlaps. This means a line will only play when a spell is finally cast.\n- Certain lines may be overly loud due to the nature of the source audio. Please report anything obnoxious so it can be manually adjusted.\n- The source audio lacks any sort of whispering or quiet lines, so I have simply lowered the volume on the stealth lines.\n- Similarly, there's a lack of diversity or even anything appropriate at all for certain lines. If anyone skilled with AI voice generation is willing to take a crack at creating new custom lines, let me know.\n- If you wish to use the optional included custom portraits, copy the folders into `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous\\Portraits` (on Windows).\n\n# Thanks & Acknowledgements\n- Uses the `wrathsoundvoicemod` mod template from [OwlcatNuGetTemplates](https://github.com/xADDBx/OwlcatNuGetTemplates) as a basis.\n- microsoftenator2022 - Provided lots of help with troubleshooting the original Wwise and project setup, leading to the creation of the dedicated `wrathsoundvoicemod` template (as well as extensive work on the original `wrathsoundmod` template) and provided corrections, fixes and suggestions for various coding issues, especially disabling the vanilla casting chants.\n- Everyone in the `#mod-dev-technical` channel of the Owlcat Discord server for various modding-related discussions and suggestions, help troubleshooting issues, and answering general questions.\n- Original audio taken from Creative Assembly's Total War Warhammer.\n",

    "Description": "# Prestige Plus for WotR \n## Requirements: [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu). [TTT-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core).\n\n- This mod adds a lot of character options to the game, especially combat maneuvers and prestige classes!\n- All features are toggleable.\n\n## Featuring\n\n### Combat Maneuver+\n- You can Disarm, Sunder, or Trip in lieu of a melee attack, and Bull Rush in lieu of a charge attack, like on tabletop!\n- [Seize the Opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/feats/seize-the-opportunity-combat/): From Path of War\n- Kinda OP so you can make it a mythic feat instead of combat feat if you like (default off)\n- [Dirty Fighting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dirty-fighting-combat/)\n- [Surprise Maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/surprise-maneuver/)\n- [Strength Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/strength-surge-ex/)\n- [Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/ki-throw-combat/) and its mythic feat!\n- [Improved Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-ki-throw-combat/)\n- [Binding Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/binding-throw-combat/)\n- [Enhanced Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/enhanced-ki-throw-combat/)\n### [Grapple Mechanic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Grapple)\n![Grapple](https://github.com/YLMstring/Prestige-Plus/assets/61271096/0fa718b4-4dbe-4cf2-8e5d-e4d19b696999)\n- This is how I implement it:\n1. There are 3 kinds of grapples in the game. My Grapple Mechanic is very close to tabletop. Shifter and beast shape grapples stay owlcat-brew but once the character takes Grapple (Improved Grapple) feat, their grapple mechanics would be turned into mine. Finally, monster grapples stay the way it is in vanilla.\n2. If you are grappled, you can attempt to break the grapple by making a combat maneuver check (DC equal to your opponent’s CMD; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or Thievery check (with a DC equal to your opponent’s CMD). If you succeed, you break the grapple as a standard action. However, if you fail nothing happens, you don't use your standard action.\n3. You can only tie up pinned creatures, and then they still need to be grappled. The rope would be bursted if you release grapple, because you don't have time to tie someone up properly in combat. They are not helpless but can become the target of Coup De Grace. Additionally, grapple actions against them auto-succeed, they're auto pinned by the rope and their Thievery check DC to escape is higher.\n- Added Feats: Grapple (Improved Grapple), Greater Grapple, Rapid Grappler, Unfair Grip, Pinning Knockout, Pinning Rend, Savage Slam, Dramatic Slam, Hamatula Strike, Throat Slicer\n- Added Mythic Feats and Abilities (inspired by tabletop abilities of the same name): Grapple (Mythic), Uncanny Grapple, Aerial Assault, Knot Expert, Meat Shield, Maneuver Expert\n- Added Familiar: Crab King\n- Added Alchemist Discovery: Tentacle\n### [Deific

Your bonus on this check is equal to 2 + your kineticist level + your Constitution modifier (treat the blast as a Huge creature). The DC for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.\n- It takes effect as per tabletop rules, but the break-free part is still owl-brew.\n- Enduring Spells Stay On Death (default on): Now with Enduring Spells, your buff stay on death, less save scumming :)\n- Dimensional Retribution Bypasses Dimensional Lock (default on): Now with Dimensional Retribution, teleportation effect no longer restricted in certain areas\n- Estimated THC: Show hit chance and spell (not) saved chance in turn based mode.

(gold : hp = 3:2)\n- Weak Crits against Enemies: Symmetrical with owlcat weak crits settings, making it fair (default off)\n- English Learning Mode: Show English dialogues along with any other language of yours (default off)\n- Lazy Crusade: Global map speed * 1000, reveal range * 1000, unlimited army movement, easier level up (default off)\n- Spell Turning effects no longer reflect touch spells and AoE spells, as per tabletop\n- Razmiri Mask no longer reflects anything more than Aroden Belt would\n- Enemy AI now recognize your permanent Spell Turning effects and act like a sane person\n- Fix Difficulty CMD Tripple-Dipped: This will significantly reduce enemy CMD at higher difficulties. CMD is calculated by adding STR bonus, DEX bonus and AC bonus, which means difficulty stat advancement is applied 3 times in vanilla, leading to total madness.\n- Fix Power Attack: now working as descripted: This bonus to damage is halved (–50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon. Note that Piranha Strike has the same bug but it isn't fixed because this might give Piranha Strike an edge over Power Attack, which is pretty coool.\n- Fix the bug that prone unit can be tripped.

    "Description": "## Random Equipment 2\n\n [ModMenu 1.3.2+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) is required.\n\n This a mod for Pathfinder: WOTR that will add random game loot to any container the player interacts with based on a percentage chance. The loot already inside the container is untouched by the mod and will only add to it. The loot possible is based on your level and shouldn't give anything inappropriately OP.\n\n This is the second version of Random Equipment. The entire mod has been rewritten from the ground up. While not a whole lot has changed on the front end\n lots have changed on the back end of things. This opens up a options for user customizations in the future.  This mod is save safe and can be installed \n during a playthrough or removed. It will break nothing.\n \n Updates include:\n * New settings menu using WittleWolfie's [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases). The lets you customize your random item experience!\n\tEach type of container can have it's own chances of containing loot and the level modifiers that get applied.\n * Containers can now add some usables to the container for a little extra spice.\n * Option to see your roll each time you open that container. Rolls use the base dice system from the game so no blaming me for your bad luck!\n\n Settings (found under the games settings menu under the tab Mods:\n * There are 3 sections:\n\t* Standard: These are the settings for  normal every day container you find\n\t* Hidden: These are the settings for containers you require a perception check to find\n\t* Locked: These are the settings for containers that are locked.\n * Chance of Random Loot\n\t* This setting is the base chance that there is random loot in the container. If you miss this check you get nothing.\n * Chance of Random Usables\n\t* This setting is the chance that a container contains random usables in addition to whatever else is in the chest.\n * Minimum/Maximum Level Modifier\n\t* These settings determine the range of the modifiers applied to the CR/CL of the loot in the container. If you get lucky your loot might be a level or two\n\t  higher than your current level or the reverse if you are unlucky. The default settings mostly have the extreme ends at a lower chance of being rolled than\n\t  the middle of the range (bell curve). The approximate chances of getting any specific modifier is listed in the description. \n * Random Modifier Curve Shift\n\t* This setting will adjust were the middle of the bell curve mentioned above sits. Increasing it will make the Maximum modified side more likely to be rolled.\n\t  Decreasing it will move the chances closer to the Minimum Modifier side of the curve.\n * Random Modifier Curve Scale\n\t* This setting will adjust the peak of the curve. Increasing the scale will make all the numbers in the range move closer to being similar in the chances to roll.\n\t  Decreasing will make the middle of the range much more likely to be rolled making the ends of the range less likely. I suggest playing around with the sliders\n\t  to see how the effect the chances and select one that you would most want to see in your game.\n * Logging\n   \t* Verbose logging (off by default): This will log most of what is happening behind the scenes to the Player.log file.\n   \t* Show rolls in combat log (on by default): This will show your rolls in the combat log when you interact with a container.\n * Updating\n\t* Adds option to download the latest list of random loot items. If you wish to update manually you can do so with the download button. Changes can be found\n\t  at [LootListChanges](https://github.com/thehambeard/RandomEquipment/blob/main/LootListChanges.md).\n   \t  \n Notes:\n * The list of random loot that is possible is 3985 items from the game. This is a dump of the all the items in the game over 500gp (800gp for weapons). I have filtered out notable items, broken items, and most of the junk I believe.\n   If there is anything I have missed and shouldn't be part of items given do let me know and I'll remove it from the list.\n\t* 1583 weapons\n\t* 479 armors\n\t* 98 shields\n\t* 696 equipment pieces\n\t* 96 potions\n\t* 645 scrolls\n\t* 227 wands\n\t* 8 utility usables\n\t* 156 other usables\n * Random items are only ever given once so you shouldn't see any duplicates. This does not include basic usables.\n * You may see that you were successful in your roll but not get an item. This happens when a valid item in the level range can't be found. This is more common in the lower levels as I have filtered out\n   most of the junk items. If you crank the chances to 100% this could also happen due to getting all the items in your level range. When this happens the game will attempt to find a valid item again but\n   with a +1 level modifier. If that fails then no item is given. \n * The level range is your modified level -1 and your modified level.\n * There just isn't a lot of level 1 gear so seeing the same items during each play through or not getting any items despite success rolls is not uncommon during the start of the game. \n\t \n Future plans:\n * I would like to add the option for user defined loot tables! The framework is there to make this doable as I built it with that in mind. An example of the loot tables could be something like:\n\t* 50% chance of container containing loot\n\t  * 30% chance of a usable (roll on usable table)\n\t\t* 30% 1d4 Potions\n\t\t* 30% 1d4 Scrolls\n\t\t* 30% Wand\n\t\t* 10% Special usable\n\t  * 30% chance of a weapon (roll on weapons table)\n\t\t* *list of weapons types...*\n\t  * *more tables...*\n    You can see that tables can contain subtables making your random item experience very unique! I hope to add this if I get time...\n",

Can we recruit them?\n<br />A. No. They do not join the party. Trust me if you think Owl Builds are bad, you do not want to see what me trying to build an NPC would have turned out as. :P\n<br />\n<br />Q. Are these romances available to men/women?\n<br />A. All romances are available to both men and women.\n<br />\n<br />Q. How do these work with base game romances?\n<br />A. They do not prevent any main game romances from triggering or continuing. They do not contribute to triggering the Chapter 5 multi-romance confrontation scene and most of them aren't even in town for that. They all have dialogue saying they are expressly okay with you dating other people. Adding conflicts would just be extra work for content I don't want. Instead I'd rather spend that work adding ending slides for specific combinations of romances! (including some base game/mod romance combos)\n<br />\n<br />Q. Can this be added mid-game?\n<br />A. It should be safe to, but you can miss out on events or event chains if you add it too late.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Why these characters?\n<br />A. These were the characters that I had inspiration and motivation for writing.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Will you be doing [insert character]?\n<br />A. I have no current plans to do any more. If I do feel motivated to do another character in the future, you will not know about it until they are nearly done. For the immediate future, I am burned out.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Will there be any non-character post-release additions to the mod?\n<br />A. Adding Minagho meant that I had less time than I wanted to for considering additional epilogue additions. So I might add some more epilogues (mostly cross romance stuff) while I am hotfixing any bugs that are found during beta testing. I don't know exactly how many that will be though.\n<br />\n<br />Q. How do I trigger rest events?\n<br />A. These can be triggered by either setting up a camp (pre-existing camps do not work) or resting on the world map. For ease of use, in Chapter 4 you can trigger Aranka's by asking Inheribro to heal you since there are so few areas to set up a campsite. Just pretend you take a nap after he heals you.\n<br />\n<br />Q. How do I trigger the romances?\n<br />A. For Aranka, Nurah, Targona, and Terendelev you need to flirt with them at least once. You should get multiple opportunities to flirt with each and you only need to choose one. Afterwards, they bring up the topic with you as part of their events and the romance will proceed in their events assuming you meet their preferences. Minagho and Nocticula will bring the topic up on their own during their events. Nocticula does have an extra event if you flirt with her in Chapter 4 though.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]HOW TO INSTALL[/size][list=1]\n<br />[*]Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)\n<br />[*]Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n<br />[*]Download the R&amp;R Mod\n<br />[*]Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab or unzip the zip and move the Epilogue folder into the Mods folder in the Wrath root directory\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5]MOD VERSION HISTORY[/size]\n<br />0.1.8 - Fix for multiple slides showing in epilogue.\n<br />0.1.7 - Added handling for if you use Terendelev's scale after killing the Ravener, but before examining its remains. Fixed a minor issue with Targona's Book Event 2 if you romance her in certain routes.\n<br />0.1.6 - Fixed an issue with Minagho Book 3 for Minagho's Demon route. Minor tweaks to some Nocticula book conditions. Fixed some typos.\n<br />0.1.5 - Fixed an issue with Miangho Book 1 for the Dragon and Legend routes. Fixed some detection of Anevia in city for Minagho. Fixed an issue with Storyteller starting Minagho Book 3.\n<br />0.1.4 - Fixed an issue with Nocticula's epilogues. Fixed a conflict between Expanded Epilogue's Nahydrian/Nocticula slide and the Nocticula's new slides in this mod. Tweaked trigger conditions to hopefully fix Storyteller's Chapter 5 options not appearing. Fixed an issue with Minagho Book 2 for Legends and Dragons. Fixed an issue with Targona's Lich and Demon routes. Added a tweak to hopefully fix most saves that suffered from the Minagho issue fixed last patch.\n<br />0.1.3 - Fix for Minagho's Chapter 4 events not properly registering\n<br />0.1.2 - Fix for a bug with Nocticula's final dialogue.\n<br />0.1.1 - I think I fixed the issue with Ternedelev's scale failing. Fixed an issue with you being unable to talk to Anevia to trigger Terendelev's finale for non-Aeons. Adjusted the Aranka Chapter 3 start so that it can only be triggered after the Azata intro.\n<br />0.1.0 - Beta release!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]KNOWN ISSUES[/size]\n<br />Due to limited availability of triggers, some auto-triggering book events might be a little abrupt\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]MOD COMPATIBILITY[/size]\n<br />100% compatible with Expanded Epilogue. Even enables one slide that was left as unavailable (Palace+Targona Romance). 1.2.3 or later is recommended as I added some compatibility stuff in that patch, but any recent version should work.\n<br />\n<br />Toybox is (mostly) compatible, there has been a report of \"Show Conditional Responses\" causing issues. So if there are issues try turning that option off first. Also I do feel like mentioning that the option to preview the results of answers can occasionally cause some display issues such as text going off of the screen.\n<br />\n<br />Woljif Romance and Gracious Friendships should be compatible to the best of my knowledge as I don't believe either of them interact with any files that I am interacting with. If there is a problem please let me know.\n<br />\n<br />I know Ebon's Content mod adds new races. This won't break anything, but I do not have handling for them so they will get the default dialogue for any dialogue that has alternate possibilities for short races (except Goblin?) and long-lived races. If there are any other mods that add races, this would also apply to them.\n<br />\n<br />Portrait mods might override the portraits added for Aranka, Targona, and Terendelev (both versions). Book events retain the portraits from this mod. Fix seems to be deleting the portraits from the portrait mod directories.\n<br />\n<br />I am currently unaware of any other mods that could interact with any files that I interact with.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]SPECIAL THANKS[/size]\n<br />Anna_Olive_Art for taking the commissions for the artwork. You can check out her art or commission at [url=https://www.artstation.com/annacarolinaoliveira]https://www.artstation.com/annacarolinaoliveira[/url] or on Reddit as u/Anna_Olive_Art\n<br />WittleWolfie for creating Blueprint Core, which was used for creating this mod\n<br />Bubbles for creating Bubbleviewer, which was essential for quickly finding all the variables I used\n<br />Narria for porting Data Viewer and creating Toy Box, both of which were essential for working on this\n<br />ADDB for work on maintaining Toy BoxBalkoth for the portrait injection code from the Summoner mod\n<br />Stratagemini, Starrok, and Kand for various assistance while working on the mod\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]HEADS UP FOR OTHER MODDERS[/size]\n<br />There are too many files to list everything I changed, but the main stuff that I am modifying are Anevia and Storyteller dialogue files. I am also interacting with files for all six of the characters, Hulrun, Chun, Inheribro, Goddess Summit, Blackwater, Wintersun, Pulura's Falls, Ravener remains, final Legend dialogue, and some epilogues. Might be missing some, but that should give an idea of what might cause compatibility issues. Give me a heads up, and I have no issue with adding compatibility functions if this steps on your toes assuming I can.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]LICENSE[/size]\n<br />MIT License\n<br />Copyright (c) 2021 TylerGoeringer\n<br />Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n<br />of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n<br />in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n<br />to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n<br />copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n<br />furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n<br />The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n<br />copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n<br />THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n<br />IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

X is the DC and will create a modifier based on it and the a, b, c parameters.\n    The goal is to give lower DCs a bigger boost and the higher DCs a smaller amount.  I would suggest using a graphing calculator to fine tune your parameters if there is something specific you are looking for.\n    \nThere are a few presets that can be picked from or you can set your own.  It is up to you.\nBelow each setting is a chart to preview your changes XX -> YY. XX is the base DC, and YY is the modified DC.\nSave button will save any changes you have made and set the preset.  IF YOU CHANGE WHAT PRESET YOU ARE USING YOU STILL MUST HIT SAVE.\n\nIf Modders want to add items to list call WrathScalingItemDCs.ScalingDC.ScalingDCAPI.AddItem(BlueprintItemEquipment blueprintItemEquipment) from your mod.\n",

    "Description": "# Snap Shot Approach mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nIn the same vein as Point Blank Shot forcing character to move to 30 feet range before attacking, this mod adds additional settings to force character into Snap Shot range when PBS is enabled.\nRanges are customizable for each snap shot feat.\n\nExamples for clarity:\nPoint Blank Shot is disabled: character uses ranged weapon range\nPoint Blank Shot is enabled, no Snap Shot feats: character is forced into 30 feet range (or weapon range if it's less)\nPoint Blank Shot is enabled and character has Snap Shot: character is forced into Snap Shot approach range (default 5 feet, customizable between 0 and 30)\n\nAlso has optional fix to always have base Snap Shot threat range be 5 feet instead of being affected by character size changes. Enabled by default\n\n## Installation\n1. Install Unity Mod Manager\n2. Install Mod Menu\n3. Install this mod.",

Uninstalling might break your save.\n* I do not take any responsibility for broken saves or any other damage. Use this software at your own risk.\n* Please DON'T REPORT BUGS you encounter to Owlcat Games while mods are active.\n* BE AWARE that all mods are WIP and may fail.\n\nInstallation\n-----------\n* You will need [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).\n* Follow the installation procedure (tl;dr; select game, select folder, press install).\n* Download a release or rebuild your own [https://github.com/Truinto/SpellPouch/releases](https://github.com/Truinto/SpellPouch/releases).\n* Switch to the mod tab and drop the zip file into the manager.\n* If you have DarkCodex installed, only use version 1.3.0 or higher.\n\nContact\n-----------\n@Fumihiko me on the Owlcat Pathfinder discord: [https://discord.com/invite/wotr](https://discord.com/invite/wotr)\n\nAbility Groups\n-----------\nAbility Groups let you bundle abilities and activatables into a single foldable actionbar slot. They have a black border. \\\n![example group](/resources/example-group.jpg) \\\nThere are already some predefined groups for class features that are related to each other or use the same resource (like bard songs).\nYou can place the group on your action bar or open the folding view to place the abilities on your action bar directly. \\\nThe groups are defined in this file: \"Mods/SpellPouch/DefGroups.json\"\n\nEach group has these properties:\n- Title: Name of the group; must be unique\n- Description: Text displayed in the group's body; can be empty/null\n- Icon: Icon to use for this group; if icon is null, it will display the first active activatable or, if non are active, the first ability's icon\n- Guids: a identifier list of all abilities/activatables that are related to that group; if a guid is used in multiple groups, only the first group will apply\n\nYou may edit this file and reload the groups with the button in the mod's menu. There is also a button to unlock the groups.\nThis will display all groups for all characters, even if they have no matching abilities. To add/remove abilities with drag&drop mechanic, hold SHIFT will doing so.\nSimply hold shift and drag any ability on the group's icon to add it. \\\n![add ability](/resources/adding-ability.jpg) \\\nUnfold a group, hold shift and drag an ability from it onto the map to remove it again. \\\n![remove ability](/resources/remove-ability.jpg) \\\nHold shift and drag an ability onto another ability to create a new group. You will be prompted to give a new unique title name. \\\n![creating group](/resources/creating-group.jpg) \\\nTo delete a group altogether, hold shift and drag the group onto the map. This will also prompt a confirmation. \\\n![delete group](/resources/delete-group.jpg) \\\nYou can re-order groups by holding shift and draging an ability either on the left or right side of an existing ability. \\\nPlacing it left, will move it to the left of the target ability. \\\n![move left](/resources/move-left.jpg) \\\nPlacing it right, will move it to the right of the target ability. \\\n![move right](/resources/move-right.jpg) \\\nChanges will affect all party members equally. Remember to disable 'Unlock Groups' again, otherwise you might edit them unintentionally.\n\nSpell Groups\n-----------\nYou can also create Spell Groups. They have a grey border. \\\n![example spell group](/resources/spell-group.jpg) \\\nSpell Groups behave a lot like Ability Groups. But they are unique for each character. \nYou can add any spell you like, as long as it can be cast. Variant spells cannot be added. Pick one of the variants instead. \\\nTo cast a spell, unfold it and click on any spell. Or you may click the group itself to cast the first available spell. \\\nYou may also use auto cast. It will automatically advance to the next spell, when you run out of spell slots.\n\nBuilding\n-----------\nIf you want to compile this project, you will need to download the DarkCodex repository as well.\n\nFAQ\n-----------\nQ: Why is the placement random? \\\nA: It's not. It will place it left or right of the target ability base on which side is closer. Unfortunately there isn't a visual indicator, so if you are not aware, it will appear random.\n\n\n",

It adds additional spellbook merging options.\n\n## Patch 1.3\n\nOwlcat introduced several changes to the Spellbook Merging system in patch 1.3, that just broke the mod.\nTo quickly fix the issue I have just undid the spellbook merging changes they introduced and used the old system.\nSo people that like Owlcat's new system, you will have to wait for a while for me to figure the new system out and patch it.\nFor people that liked the older merging system, think of this as a feature instead of a bug :)\n\n## Warnings\n\n* This mod creates new blueprints and thus creates a save dependency. Once your save depends on this mod, it is not safe to uninstall it.\n\n* To be careful, install this mod just before reaching Mythic Rank 3. Test that you get the option to merge spellbooks, if not file a bug report.\n\n* I have tested this mod only with Aeon-Inquisitor, the other merges are untested (for now).\n\n* After merging spellbooks your mythic spell progression is tied to your base spellbook. So be careful when taking dips, if you don't progress your base spellbook enough, you might end up not getting the required slots to cast higher level mythic spells.\n\n* Currently for Casters that learn spells automatically (Druid, Paladin etc.), there is a bug where any new spell slots gained by merging spellbooks do not trigger learning new spells. Reload the save/game to fix the issue. I haven't tested if you can recover them if use respec and keep progressing without learning these spells.\n\n* There is an incompatibility with Tabletop Tweaks where it modifies the BloodRager spellbook. So if you want to merge BloodRager with mythic paths, disable the specific TTT tweak for it.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe patches to spellbook progressions can be disabled in the json settings file.\nIn your mod directory for this mod, you should find a UserSettings directory. Open PatchSettings.json and set any spellbook progression patch that you do not want to false.\nNote that this only disables the spellbook progression patches, you will still get options to merge spellbooks, you can just chose not to merge if you don't want to.\n\n## Mythic Paths\n\n### Angel\n\nAngel can merge with the followin additional spellbooks\n* Palading (This needs thorough testing to see if higher level spells are castable and if the progressions are applied correctly. Be warned.)\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Witch\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Crossblooded Sorcerer\n\n### Lich\n\nLich can now merge with the following spellbooks.\n\n* Druid\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n\n### Aeon\n\nAeon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n\n* WarPriest\n* Inquisitor\n* Druid\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Hunter\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Azata\nAzata gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Magus\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Druid\n* Hunter\n* BloodRager\n* Wizard\n* ExploiterWizard\n* Arcanist\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Arcanist\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Demon\nDemon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* BloodRager\n* Hunter\n* Skald\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Bard\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Arcanist\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Witch\n\n### Trickster\nTrickster gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Alchemist\n* Eldritch Scoundrel\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Witch\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Cleric\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n\n\n## Base Spellbooks\n\nThe following spellbooks have had their spell slot progressions patched to allow access to higher level spells from mythic paths.\n\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Alchemist\n* BloodRager\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Inquisitor\n* WarPriest\n* Paladin\n* Hunter (Uses the Bard spellbook)\n* Eldritch Scion (Uses the Bard progression)\n\n\nThe patched hybrid casters mentioned above can cast 7th level spells post CL 20.\n\nPaladin progression has been specifically patched for allowing Angel merge. It has not been tested well yet. The progression is tight and slower than an Angel Oracle, but can't be helped, with the current approach. But by my estimation if you stay pure Paladin, you should be able to cast level 10 Angel spells as a merged caster once you reach Mythic 9/10.\nFile an issue report if that's not the case.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to give my sincerest thanks to:\n\n1. Owlcat for this amazing game.\n2. My fellow modders from discord for inspiration and answering my questions. Particularly Narria Cabarius, Vek17, Bubbles and ArcaneTrixter.",

That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell.\n    * Shadow Enchantment\n        * You use material from the Shadow Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower. Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow enchantment, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) the normal amount of damage. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow enchantment's level (3rd) rather than the spell's normal level.\n    * Shadow Enchantment Greater\n        * This spell functions like shadow enchantment, except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spells of 5th level or lower.

When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2x the spell’s actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell’s descriptor.\n    * Encouraging Spell (Metamagic)\n\t\t* Any morale bonus granted by an encouraging spell is increased by 1.\n    * Flaring Spell (Metamagic)\n        * The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell. A flare spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor.\n    * Intensified Spell (Metamagic)\n        * An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this feat.

    "Description": "# The One Pearl mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\n### Requirements: [Mod Menu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases/latest)\n\nAdds The One Pearl, which combines powers of all pearls of power player currently has in their inventory. \n\n### Quickstart\n1. Load into your game\n2. Open Settings -> Mod Menu -> The One Pearl -> Press \"Receive\"\n3. Unequip All pearls of power you have on anyone. Otherwise they won't be tracked.\n3. Equip newly appeared One Pearl\n4. Restore spells as needed.\n\n\n### Explanation on numbers you see\nMod calculates how many pearls player has in the inventory and combines them into pool.    \nExample: Player has 2 pearls of 1st level, 1 pearl of 3th level and 1 pearl of 5th level. All are unused yet today.\nThat means that could restore potentially:\n\n4 spells of 1st level (all 4 pearls can be used on lvl 1)    \n2 spells of 2nd level (pearl of 3th and 5th level can be used here)    \n2 spells of 3rd level (pearl of 3th and 5th level can be used here)    \n1 spells of 4th level (only pearl of 5th level can be used here)    \n1 spells of 5th level (only pearl of 5th level can be used here)    \n0 spells of 6th level and above    \n\nAnd that's how number of pearl usages will look like in conversion menu.\n\nLet's say player wants  to restore 2nd level slot.  \nMod will use pearl of lowest available level that has charges.   \nIn this example that would be 3rd level pearl.     \nAfter usage numbers will go down to    \n\n3 of 1st level (2 pearls of 1st lvl and 1 pearl of 5th level)    \n1 of 2nd level (pearl of 5th level)     \n1 of 3rd level (pearl of 5th level)    \n1 of 4th level (pearl of 5th level)    \n1 of 5th level (pearl of 5th level)   \n0 of 6th level and above    \n\n\nIf you enable in settings option to have pearls apply to specific level, the picture (before usage of 3rd) would look like this:\n\n2 of 1st level      \n0 of 2nd level    \n1 of 3rd level     \n0 of 4th level    \n1 of 5th level    \n\n### Details\n\nOne Pearl automatically synchronizes resources to pearls you have on one pearl equip and on rest. So if you acquired new pearl, either re-equip One Pearl or use ability on the One Pearl item.  \n(By the way Toybox Rest All is not an real rest, so after using that you'll need to do the above actions to match pearls).\n\nWhen using One Pearl it will silently spend resources on the pearls on inventory. This will unstack your pearls one by one if they were stacked.   \n\nIf you have multiple One Pearls given to different characters, they will synchronize too.\n\nThis mod introduces save dependency. Because new item.",

    "Description": "﻿# Toggleable Throwing Weapons\n\nYou can now use a toggle to turn daggers and starknives into ranged weapons.\n\n## Implementation details\nI overrode the BlueprintItemWeapon getter in ItemEntity and ItemEntity<BlueprintItem>. I don't believe this should interfere with anything thanks to the sea of sanity checks but cannot confirm for certain.\n\n## Cross-mod compatibility\nWorks with Hambeard's Thrown Daggers mod and automatically incorperates the daggers from that (as of release 1.0). However, the RangedDaggers and RangedStars settings must be changed from their default true to false for my mod to work! There should be no conflicts with other mods but daggers from elsewhere will not be supported automatically. If/when there is a need for it I'll rig up some way to read the guids out of a supplemental JSON.\n\n## Known Quirks\nThe item names don't change by mode. I'll get to this later.\n\n\n# Credits\n\nThanks to Truinto for the AddFactOnlyParty code.\n\nThanks to ifarmpandas for figuring out the fix for AttackStatReplacement bugs\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n\n1.3.1: Works with 2.2\n\n1.3.0: Fixed compatibility with Morvarch's Playstyle expansions - thanks ifarmpandas\n\n1.2.4: Works with the 2.1\n\n1.2.3: Hopefully fixed graphical jank for the last time\n\n1.2.2: Fixed Rogue Finesse training working with thrown weapons. Turned out to be incredibly imba\n\n\n1.2.1: Fixed interaction with Way Of The Shooting Star, should fix interaction with other attack /dmg stat replacers in general. Mod thrown weapon STR damage effect no longer force-sets stat dmg multiplier to 100%\n\n1.2: Point Blank Master (and any other ranged-only paramaterized features added by mods) now apply to thrown daggers/starknives. Increased range to 30 feet. \n\n1.1: Fixed dex to melee damage cutting out, fixed some graphical jank\n",

Is literally just Chain Lightning but dealing fire damage.\n\nFire Shield: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard/ Sun Domain, Level 5 Fire Domain. Pick between Warm and Cold shield. Warm shield cuts incoming cold damage in half, reduces to none on successful save, and retaliates with fire damage when hit in melee. Cold Shield works the same but protecting from fire and retaliating with cold.\nExisting domain picks were not removed - Sun 4 / Fire 5 have two picks. 1 round per level.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later, if I can figure out how\n\nVitrolic Mist: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard: Fire Sheild, only the protection and backlash are both acid.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later.\n\nEntropic Shield: Cleric 1 self-buff. Incoming ranged attacks have 20% miss chance, non-illusion. 1 minute per level.\n\nFreezing Sphere: Wizard/Magus 6 evocation. 1d6/level cold damage to a spherical area, increased damage to water subtype.\n\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cap is 20d6 instead of 15d6 to make vaguely relevant at the same level as chain lightning/chains of fire (effectively have selective baked in), Hellfire Ray (massively more damage and defenses against it are rarer) and Cold Ice Strike (natively quickened). Available in both tabletop 40ft blast and fireball standard 20ft blast - again, to make relevant when other on-level spells have much better form factor than nuking almost everything you can see.\n\nGloomblind bolts: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Witch/Wizard necromancy. Scorching ray, only dealing negative energy damage and blinding if the target doesn't save. \n\nChanges From Tabletop: Was Conjuration (creation)[shadow] on TT but that makes about zero kinds of sense so I changed it to necromancy.\n\nHeal Mount: Level 3 Paladin. Is literally heal but you can only cast it on your animal companion. At last something to do with Paladin level 3 spell slots!\n\nKeen Edge: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Inquistor/Wizard. Gives a weapon Keen for 10 minutes per level.\n\nSpear Of Purity: Level 2 Cleric / Angel: Range touch attack, deals 1d8 per 2 levels (max 5d8) to target - half to neutral, none to good, unless target is evil outsider in which case 1d6 per level (max 10d6). Half damage on will save. Evil targets are blinded on save fail.\n\nTelekinetic Strikes: Level 2 Magus/Wizard buff: Target ally deals 1d4 extra force damage on natural weapon hits, 1 minute per level\n\n### Feats:\n---\nAbility Focus- Breath Weapon: Adds +2 DC to breath weapons. Requires a breath weapon to take (or mixblooded bloodrager). This prereq uses significant hardcoding to detect polymorphs granting breath attacks and hasn't been fully tested.\n\nBurn Resistance: Treat your level as two lower for determining nonlethal damage from burn\n\nDiscordant Song: Bardsong adds 1d6 sonic damage to ally weapon attacks. For ranged attacks, targets must also be in the area of effect.\n\nExtra Burn: Increases daily burn limit by two points\n\nExtended Buffer: Increases internal buffer size by one\n\nProdigious TWF: Use strength rather than dex for TWF prereqs, no penalty for large offhand weapon.\n\nSundering Strike: On critical hit, attempt Sunder maneuver.\n\n### Paladin Mercies:\n---\nInjured: Grants fast healing for 1 round per 2 paladin levels.\n\nEnsorcelled: Attempts Dispel Magic on lay on hands - does not ever dispel buffs on friendlies.\n(Arguable) Changes from Tabletop: Unlike other mercies this effect makes sense when used offensively so it works when used on enemies - it dispels buffs there.\n\n### Items:\n---\nBracers Of The Merciful Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase a paladin's effective level for Lay On Hands power and uses by four. \n\nBracers Of The Avenging Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase the wearer's effective level when using Smite abilities by four.\n\n### Mythic Abilities:\nMythic Kinetic Aegis: Treat Kineticist Elemental Defense as having had 1 burn invested for free, one more at MR 3/6/9.\n\n## Bugfixes\n---\n### Items\n---\nRadiance +6 (uncorrupted) now gets Holy like it should\n\n### Classes\nArcanist: Holy Water Jet no longer requires Azata/Angel mythic class\n\nCavalier: Made Order abilities actually show up in the UI. \n\nMade Order Of The Stars's Calling Channeling support ability work. \nChanges from Tabletop: Works on anything with a Channel Positive / Channel Negative keyword set, which means it will work on Warpriest and Oracle and Necromancer channels. No idea if it works on Warpriest fervor used normally.\n\nKineticist: Now has the Internal Buffer feature - reduce accepted burn by one a limited number of times per day\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifier: Gets back level 3 revelation - TT purifier has forced unique pick, said ability is not implemented and probably not implementable so giving the pick back.\n\n### Bloodlines\n\nBlooderager Phoenix Bloodline is in.\nTabletop Tweaks Base is required.\n\n### Wild Talents:\n\nElemental Defenses and Aerial Evasion now use the main burn cost system - this is *not* disableable\n\nFlame Shield correctly halves incoming frost damage\n\n### Other\n---\nFixed extra hits: Fixed some (not all) cases where an effect that should add extra damage to an attack added extra hits instead. Currently: Firebrand, Claws Of A Sacred Beast, and the chibi dragon from Dawn Of Dragons\nONLY USE ONE OF TABLETOP TWEAKS's FIX AND MINE! The game won't load if you have both active!\n\nNote: Custom Implementation used on Claws of a Sacred Beast to preserve DR peirce properties from weapon attack isn't getting the damage type completely right - is doing all phys types instead of just slashing. \n\n## Tweaks\n---\nLittle things that aren't new content but aren't bug fixes either:\n### Spells\n---\nDispels are now buff/debuff safe - dispel magic series and slayer Dispelling Attack don't dispel buffs on user's allies or debuffs on their enemies. \n\n### Reward Feature Conversion\n---\nDawn Of Dragons gave you a perma Holy Aura effect for one resolution but this was implemented as a perma-buff meaning it wouldn't persist on respec and might be losable other ways. I turned this into a feature - see modified content for more.\n\n### Crusade\n---\nMovanic Devas now use greatswords properly\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifers now get Cure Light / Cure Moderate automatically - the archetype takes till level five to not be Oracle But Worse In Literally Every Way otherwise.\n\nPurifier Celestial Armor now works exactly like Armor Training of a fighter with 4 less fighter levels - including Advanced Armor Training. This hard-requires Tabletop Tweaks Base and will not activate if it can't detect that.\n\nStigmatized Witch gets Patron selection back - I consider switching from prepared to spontaneous a side-grade at best, with Witch's weak spell list downgrading patron to curse at the same time was just a nerfing. Comes with options to select Ember's patron. Disabled by default.\n\n### Bloodline Powers\nUnlimited Sorcerer Bloodline Claws: Removes use limit on abyssal/draconic bloodline claws. \nCombine Sorcerer Dragon Claws: Unifies all sorc bloodline claw abilities into one - if you have multiple bloodlines you get the lvl 11 energy damage for every last one.\n\n## Content Modifications\n---\nNot-so-little changes I've made to base game things. These all default to off.\nThese have nothing to do with the tabletop game - my changes to Owlcat Original Content.\n\n### Dawn Of Dragons Custom Reward\n---\nThe reward for picking the good option in this quest is almost insultingly bad. A vendor trash item and a perma-buff of a spell you almost certainly already have on most paths and that Angel gets a strictly better version of automatically.\n\nThis annoyed me so I changed it.\n\nIf you enable the Custom Reward, instead of giving you a perma holy aura buff the silver dragon gives you what's more or less perma-sorta-geniekind with this setting enabled. 1d6 cold on attacks (not an extra hit just damage, it's like having Elder Frost on everything) and +5 natural armor enhancement. Overall weaker effect but one that's much less likely to overlapped. Can set to be Angel only or for all paths with settings.\n\n### Crusade Events\n---\nMade rewards from Monster Slayers and Local Production crusade events permanent if options are selected because it makes more sense.\n\n\n##Coming Soon:\n\nOver\n\nInternal Buffer will be more elegant.\n\nBloodline Mutations (Havoc first)\n\nEarth Tremor spell\n\nMountain Witch Patron\n\nBanishing Warden Paladin Archetype\n\nTwin Metamagic Rods\n\nKinetic Lancer Kineticist Archetype\n\nBasic Elemental Kinesis Utility Talents\n\nFlumefire Rage feat\n\n\n",

Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)\n2. Download the [Mod](https://github.com/BarleyFlour/VisualAdjustments2/releases/latest/download/VisualAdjustments2.zip)\n3. Do either 3B or 3C.\n\n* 3B Extract the archive and put the mod folder into 'Mods' folder of the Game (\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure\\Mods)\n\n* 3C Drag the Downloaded Zip into Unity Mod Manager.\n\n5. Run the game and load your save\n6. Open the interface by opening your inventory and clicking on \"Visual\" in the top right corner.\n\n## Features\nCustom eye pictures.\nJust place a .png in the custom portrait folder named \"Eye.png\" and it will appear as the eye image (though you may have to reload a save/transition into a new area for it to update if you just switched portrait). The appropriate aspect ratio is 22:3 (i.e. 22 units of width for each 3 units of height)\n\n[Sample Eye Image](https://github.com/BarleyFlour/VisualAdjustments2/blob/master/Eye.png)\n\n## FAQ\n**Q:** What does the \"EE\" in \"EE Picker\" mean? \n\n**A:** It means \"EquipmentEntity\", they are individual pieces of equipment e.g. a Helmet, Hair, Gloves, Etc.\n\n**Q:** My game is lagging after an update, whats that about?\n**A:** It is simply the mod re-caching all of the needed assets, this will only happen once when the game has been updated.\n##\n\n\n## Features in Visual Adjustments that are not in Visual Adjustments 2 (List may not be complete)\n* Overrides.¹\n* View Overrides (This is planned though)\n* Individual custom colors for Hair, Skin, Etc.¹\n\n1: Similar functionality can be achieved by using the EE Picker though\n\n## Planned Features\n* View overrides\n* Special visual page specifically for Animal Companions\n* Proper handling of Kitsune's Dual Doll\n* EE Picker Profiles (Saving a given setup)\n* Buff blocker profiles\n* Scale Override\n\n## Note\n* It is best to leave the base-game visual settings on default.\n",

The romance path is available for both male and female characters, and begins in Act 3, with content continuing through the rest of the game up to and including the epilogue. At last you can give the tiefling the love he deserves, but winning his heart won't be easy...\n<br />Be aware that like official owlcat romances, this romance path contains wilderness camping events, command room events, and in-base dialogs, as well as additional content in existing scenes! You will miss out on content if you don't set up camp in wilderness maps once in a while, or if you don't ever visit the command room.\n<br />\n<br />WARNING\n<br />This mod does create save dependencies once you've interacted with any of the mod content. You can safely uninstall it before you re-recruit Woljif, as none of the new mod content is included until then. After that point, your saves will no longer be able to load without the mod as they will have the new content written into the save.",

    "Description": "# WIT\n Pathfinder: WotR Inventory Tweak\n\n\nQuick Cast (formally known as Inventory Tweaks in Kingmaker).\nthis mod is Save Game safe, install/uninstall will not break your saves.\n\nHow to use:\n* Install the mod using Unity Mod Manager\n* The first time the mod is ran the UI might be in an odd location.\n* All four edges of the window can be clicked and dragged to move the window where you would like it.\n* The bottom corner jewel can be clicked and dragged to scale the window to your liking as well.\n* These settings will be remembered going forward.\n* The upper left jewel can be clicked to minimize the UI window.  Click the box it minimizes to to restore the window.  The minimized box can be moved with click dragging as well. You can set the hotkey in the settings menu (bottom left jewel button).\n* The upper right jewel will expand / contract all the items in the current view port\n* The lower left jewel will be for settings, this area can be used to set the hotkey to minimize/maximize the window (default: ctrl-z)\n* The lower right jewel will scale the window by click dragging.\n* There are 6 viewports, Spells, Scrolls, Potions, Wands, Special, Favorite\n  * Spells shows you the current characters available spells. As you use the spells they will be removed from the list.  If there are no available spells then the view port will say so. The first number within the circle is the DC for the spell, the second is how many more times you can cast the spell for the day.\n  * Scrolls, Potions, Wands shows any of these items that are in the inventory.  Clicking on them will use the item.  Items will always be used by the current character. The first number within the circle is how many of the item you have stacked in your inventory.  Any unstacked items, such as partially used wands will be shown in a separate entry. The second number is the amount of charges remaining.  Potions and scroll always have 1 charge.  A note on belt slots.  The mod uses belt slot 5 to handle the items being used.  If you have anything in belt slot 5 it will be removed back to your inventory.  After using a wand if there are charges remaining it will stay in belt slot 5 till something else is used or the charges are exhausted.\n  * Special shows abilities the current character has, including Activatable Abilities.  Under the abilities tab, it will show usable abilities.  You may see items listed here if you have those items in a belt slot.  This is normal behavior due to how the belt slots work in game. The first number within the circle is again the DC when using this ability. The second number is how many uses are left on the ability.  Under the Activatable abilities tab, it will show abilities that can toggled or activated, such as Fighting Defensively.  The first circle will have an X in it if it active. The second square will have how many more times the ability can be activated for the day.\n  * Favorites is not implemented yet, but it will hold any spell, item, ability that you deem to have in one place making these commonly used entries even easier.\n* To use any entry simply click on it and it will automatically use the item if the target is self, or it'll bring up the target selector UI if the entry can be used on others.\n* To Hide/Show a list of entries under the purple header, click on the purple header and it will either expand or collapse all of the entries.  Remembering the status of these headers is planned for a future release.  As of now the status will be reset each new scene that the player visits.\n\n### Known issues (I will try to keep this as current as possible):\n* A few minor graphical glitches that will be ironed out as I go.\n\n### FOR BUGS USE THE ISSUE TRACKER, DO NOT USE THE ISSUE TRACKER TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS!\n### SUGGESTIONS CAN BE MADE VIA DISCORD #mod-user-general (@MENTION hambeard#1046)\n### DO NOT DM ME WITH SUGGESTIONS.\n### ANYONE NOT ADHERING TO THOSE SIMPLE RULES WILL BE IGNORED OR REPORTED FOR REPEAT SEVERE ABUSERS.\n",
